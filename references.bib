	magnetic fusion devices. Comparisons among different ion temperature
	techniques and simulations are even rarer. Here we present a comparison
	of ion temperature measurements in the boundary of the Alcator C-Mod
	tokamak from three different diagnostics: charge exchange recombination
	spectroscopy (CXRS), an ion sensitive probe (ISP), and a retarding
	field analyzer (RFA). Comparison between CXRS and the ISP along with
	close examination of the ISP measurements reveals that the ISP is
	space charge limited. It is thus unable to measure ion temperature
	in the high density (>10 19 m −3 ) boundary plasma of C-Mod with
	its present geometry. Comparison of ion temperatures measured by
	CXRS and the RFA shows fair agreement. Ion and electron parallel
	heat flow is analyzed with a simple 1D fluid code. The code takes
	divertor measurements as input and results are compared to the measured
	ratios of upstream ion to electron temperature, as inferred respectively
	by CXRS and a Langmuir probe. The analysis reveals the limits of
	the fluid model at high Knudsen number. The upstream temperature
	ratio is under predicted by a factor of 2. Heat flux limiters (kinetic
	corrections) to the fluid model are necessary to match experimental
	data. The values required are found to be close to those reported
	in kinetic simulations. The 1D code is benchmarked against the 2D
	plasma fluid code UEDGE with good agreement.},

  abstract = {H-mode operation is the choice for next-step tokamak devices based
	either on conventional or advanced tokamak physics. This choice,
	however, comes at a significant cost for both the conventional and
	advanced tokamaks because of the effects of edge-localized modes
	(ELMs). ELMs can produce significant erosion in the divertor and
	can affect the β limit and reduced core transport regions needed
	for advanced tokamak operation. Recent experimental results from
	DIII-D have demonstrated a new operating regime, the quiescent H-mode
	regime, which solves these problems. We have achieved quiescent H-mode
	operation which is ELM-free and yet has good density control. In
	addition, we have demonstrated that an internal transport barrier
	can be produced and maintained inside the H-mode edge barrier for
	long periods of time (>3.5 s or >25 energy confinement times τ E
	). By forming the core barrier and then stepping up the input power,
	we have achieved β N H 89 = 7 for up to 10 times the τ E of 160 ms.
	The β N H 89 values of 7 substantially exceed the value of 4 routinely
	achieved in standard ELMing \mbox{H-mode.} The key factors in creating
	the quiescent H-mode operation are neutral beam injection in the
	direction opposite to the plasma current (counter injection) plus
	cryopumping to reduce the density. Density control in the quiescent
	H-mode is possible because of the presence of an edge MHD oscillation,
	the edge harmonic oscillation, which enhances the edge particle transport
	while leaving the energy transport unaffected.},

  abstract = {In the investigation of stability of a plasma confined by magnetic
	fields some of the most important modes of oscillation are those
	with long wavelength parallel to the magnetic field and short wavelength
	perpendicular to it. However, these characteristics conflict with
	the requirement of periodicity in a toroidal magnetic field with
	shear. This conflict can be resolved by transforming the calculation
	to one in an infinite domain without periodicity constraints. This
	transformation is the starting point for a full investigation of
	the magnetohydrodynamic stability of an axisymmetric plasma at large
	toroidal wave number $n$. (Small values of $n$ can be studied by
	direct numerical computation but this fails when $n$ is large.) For
	$n\gg $ 1 there are two distinct length scales in the problem and
	a systematic approximation is developed around an eikonal representation,
	formally as an expansion in $1/n$. In lowest order the oscillations
	of each magnetic surface are decoupled and a local eigenvalue is
	obtained. However, the mode structure is not fully determined in
	this lowest order. In higher orders a second eigenvalue equation
	is obtained which completes the determination of the structure of
	the mode and relates the local eigenvalue of the lower order theory
	to the true eigenvalue for the problem. This higher order theory
	shows that unstable modes are localized in the vicinity of the surface
	with the smallest local eigenvalue, that the true eigenvalue is close
	to the lowest local eigenvalue and that the most unstable high $n$
	modes occur for $n\rightarrow $ $\infty $. Hence the local theory,
	which involves no more than the solution of an ordinary differential
	equation, is normally adequate for the determination of stability
	of any axisymmetric plasma to high mode number oscillations.},

  title = {Study of Density Fluctuations and Particle Transport at the Edge
	of I-Mode Plasmas},
  school = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The wide range of plasma parameters available on Alcator C-Mod has
	led to the accessibility of many regimes of operation. Since its
	commissioning, C-Mod has accessed the Linear ohmic confinement, Saturated
	ohmic confinement, L-Mode and ELM-free, ELMy and Enhanced D? H-Mode
	regimes. Recently, another novel regime, the I-Mode, has been identified[1][2][3][4].
	I-modes feature the presence of steep H-Mode-like electron and ion
	temperature gradients at the edge of the plasma with L-Mode-like
	density profiles. The I-Mode, in contrast to the H-mode, shows very
	weak degrada- tion of energy confinement with increased input power,
	and routinely reaches H98 > 1 while operating at low edge collisionalities
	(?ped ?0.1), making it a good candidate for reactor relevant tokamaks.
	Also relevant for reactors, this regime can be sustained in steady
	state for more than ?15 energy confinement times without the need
	for ELMs to regulate particle and impurity confinement. Changes in
	edge density, temperature and magnetic field fluctuations accompany
	the L-mode to I-mode transition, with reduction of fluctuations in
	the 50-150kHz range as well as the appearance of a Weakly Coherent
	Mode (WCM) in the 200-300kHz range, analogous to the Quasi-Coherent
	Mode (QCM) characteristic of the Enhanced D? H-mode. Previous work[4]
	has established a connection between the midrange fluctuation suppression
	and reduction in the effective thermal diffusivity, ?ef f , in the
	pedestal region. The mechanism in I-mode for maintaining sufficient
	particle transport to avoid impurity accumulation and instabilities
	has been unclear. The O-mode reflectometry system has been extensively
	used for the characterization and detection of the I-mode and the
	WCM, in part, enhanced by upgrades to the system which enabled the
	baseband detection of density fluctuations at an array of cutoff
	locations at the edge of the plasma[5][6][7]. Using a novel model,
	the autopower signals of reflectometry channels detecting the density
	fluctuations have been decomposed into a broadband component and
	a WCM component. The latter is then used to estimate the intensity
	of the WCM. In parallel, the particle transport across the LCFS in
	I-mode plasmas has been estimated using a volume integrated particle
	transport model, where ionization source measurements are acquired
	using D? profiles measured near the outboard midplane. This model
	takes into account the anisotropic ionization source density around
	the periphery of the plasma by introducing an asymmetry factor, ?,
	which is then estimated using a study of I-Mode to H-Mode transitions.
	The results imply that measurements at the outboard midplane overestimate
	the surface-averaged influx. Finally, a comparison has been made
	between the particle flux across the LCFS of the I-mode and the intensity
	of the WCM, which shows a generally positive correlation between
	the two. This is supporting evidence that the WCM is, in fact, responsible
	for maintaining particle and impurity transport across the edge of
	the I-mode energy transport barrier.},

  abstract = {The understanding and predictive capability of transport physics and
	plasma confinement is reviewed from the perspective of achieving
	reactor-scale burning plasmas in the ITER tokamak, for both core
	and edge plasma regions. Very considerable progress has been made
	in understanding, controlling and predicting tokamak transport across
	a wide variety of plasma conditions and regimes since the publication
	of the ITER Physics Basis (IPB) document ( 1999 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/39/12/301]
	39 2137?2664 ). Major areas of progress considered here follow. (1)
	Substantial improvement in the physics content, capability and reliability
	of transport simulation and modelling codes, leading to much increased
	theory/experiment interaction as these codes are increasingly used
	to interpret and predict experiment. (2) Remarkable progress has
	been made in developing and understanding regimes of improved core
	confinement. Internal transport barriers and other forms of reduced
	core transport are now routinely obtained in all the leading tokamak
	devices worldwide. (3) The importance of controlling the H-mode edge
	pedestal is now generally recognized. Substantial progress has been
	made in extending high confinement H-mode operation to the Greenwald
	density, the demonstration of Type I ELM mitigation and control techniques
	and systematic explanation of Type I ELM stability. Theory-based
	predictive capability has also shown progress by integrating the
	plasma and neutral transport with MHD stability. (4) Transport projections
	to ITER are now made using three complementary approaches: empirical
	or global scaling, theory-based transport modelling and dimensionless
	parameter scaling (previously, empirical scaling was the dominant
	approach). For the ITER base case or the reference scenario of conventional
	ELMy H-mode operation, all three techniques predict that ITER will
	have sufficient confinement to meet its design target of Q = 10 operation,
	within similar uncertainties.},

  pages = {1523},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment conducted
	to estimate the thermal response and erosion lifetime of the ITER
	divertor targets clad either with carbon-fibre composite or tungsten
	during type I ELMs. The one-dimensional thermal/erosion model, used
	for the analyses, is briefly described. It includes all the key surface
	heat transfer processes such as evaporation, melting, and radiation,
	and their interaction with the bulk thermal response, and it is based
	on an implicit finite-difference scheme, which allows for temperature-dependent
	material properties. The cases analysed clarify the influence of
	several ELM parameters on the heat transfer and erosion processes
	at the target (i.e. characteristic plasma ELM energy loss from the
	pedestal, fraction of the energy reaching the divertor, broadening
	of the strike-points during ELMs, duration and waveform of the ELM
	heat load) and design/material parameters (i.e. inclination of the
	target, type and thickness of the armour material, and for tungsten
	only, fraction of the melt layer loss). Comparison is made between
	cases where all ELMs are characterized by the same fixed averaged
	parameters, and cases where instead the characteristic parameters
	of each ELM are evaluated in a random fashion by using a standard
	Monte Carlo technique, based on distributions of some of the variables
	of interest derived from experiments in today's machines. Although
	uncertainties rule out providing firm quantitative predictions, the
	results of this study are useful to illustrate trends. Based on the
	results, the implications on the design and operation are discussed
	and priorities are determined for the R&D needed to reduce the remaining
	uncertainties.},

	rotation and neutral beam injected torque near zero. Previous studies
	have shown that QH-mode operation can be accessed only if sufficient
	radial shear in the plasma flow is produced near the plasma edge.
	In past experiments, this flow shear was produced using neutral beam
	injection (NBI) to provide toroidal torque. In recent experiments,
	this torque was nearly completely replaced by the torque from applied
	NRMFs. The application of the NRMFs does not degrade the global energy
	confinement of the plasma. Conversely, the experiments show that
	the energy confinement quality increases with lower plasma rotation.
	Furthermore, the NRMF torque increases plasma resilience to locked
	modes at low rotation. These results open a path towards QH-mode
	utilization as an edge-localized mode (ELM)-stable H-mode in the
	self-heated burning plasma scenario, where toroidal momentum input

  abstract = {A series of experiments, examining the confinement properties of ion
	cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heated H mode plasmas, has
	been carried out on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. Alcator C-Mod is a
	compact tokamak that operates at high particle, power and current
	densities at toroidal fields up to 8 T. Under these conditions the
	plasma is essentially thermal with very little contribution to the
	stored energy from energetic ions (typically no more than 5%) and
	with T i ~T e . Most of the data were taken with the machine in a
	single null `closed' divertor configuration with the plasma facing
	components clad in molybdenum tiles. The data include those taken
	both before and after the first wall surfaces were coated with boron,
	with emphasis on the latter. H modes obtained from plasmas run on
	boronized walls typically had a lower impurity content and radiated
	power and attained a higher stored energy than those run on bare
	molybdenum. Confinement enhancement, the energy confinement time
	normalized to L mode scaling, for discharges with boronized walls,
	ranged from 1.6 to 2.4. The unique operating regime of the Alcator
	C-Mod device provided a means for extending the tests of global scaling
	laws to parameter ranges not previously accessible. For example,
	the Alcator C-Mod edge localized mode (ELM)-free data were found
	to be 1.1 to 1.6 times the ITERH93 scaling and the ELMy data almost
	2.0 to 2.8 times the ITERH92 ELMy scaling law, suggesting that the
	size scaling in both scalings may be too strong. While both ELM-free
	and ELMy discharges were produced, the ELM characteristics were not
	easily compared with observations on other devices. No large, low
	frequency ELMs were seen despite the very high edge pressure and
	temperature gradients that were attained. For all of our H mode discharges,
	a clear linear relationship between the edge temperature pedestal
	and the temperature gradient in the core plasma was observed; the
	discharges with the `best' transport barriers also showing the greatest
	improvement in core c},

	insight into the physics of the HÂ mode regime. Several studies show
	that electron temperature is not the key parameter that controls
	the L-H transition. Gradients of edge temperature and pressure are
	much more promising candidates for elements of such parameters. They
	systematically increase during the L phases of discharges which make
	a transition to HÂ mode, and these increases are typically larger
	than the increases in the underlying quantities. The quality of HÂ mode
	confinement is strongly correlated with the height of the HÂ mode
	pedestal for the pressure. The gradient of the pressure is limited
	by MHD modes, in particular by ideal kink ballooning modes with finite
	mode number n. For a wide variety of discharges, the width of the
	barrier for electron pressure is well described by a relationship
	that is proportional to (Î² ped p ) 1/2 . A new regime of confinement,
	called the quiescent HÂ mode, which provides steady state operation
	with no ELMs, low radiated power and normal HÂ mode confinement,
	has been discovered. A coherent edge MHD mode provides adequate particle
	transport to control the plasma density while permitting the pressure
	pedestal to remain almost identical to that observed in ELMing discharges.},

  abstract = {Joint experiment/theory/modelling research has led to increased confidence
	in predictions of the pedestal height in ITER. This work was performed
	as part of a US Department of Energy Joint Research Target in FY11
	to identify physics processes that control the H-mode pedestal structure.
	The study included experiments on C-Mod, DIII-D and NSTX as well
	as interpretation of experimental data with theory-based modelling
	codes. This work provides increased confidence in the ability of
	models for peeling–ballooning stability, bootstrap current, pedestal
	width and pedestal height scaling to make correct predictions, with
	some areas needing further work also being identified. A model for
	pedestal pressure height has made good predictions in existing machines
	for a range in pressure of a factor of 20. This provides a solid
	basis for predicting the maximum pedestal pressure height in ITER,
	which is found to be an extrapolation of a factor of 3 beyond the
	existing data set. Models were studied for a number of processes
	that are proposed to play a role in the pedestal n e and T e profiles.
	These processes include neoclassical transport, paleoclassical transport,
	electron temperature gradient turbulence and neutral fuelling. All
	of these processes may be important, with the importance being dependent
	on the plasma regime. Studies with several electromagnetic gyrokinetic
	codes show that the gradients in and on top of the pedestal can drive
	a number of instabilities.},

  abstract = {Progress in the area of MHD stability and disruptions, since the publication
	of the 1999 ITER Physics Basis document ( 1999 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/39/12/301]
	39 2137–2664 ), is reviewed. Recent theoretical and experimental
	research has made important advances in both understanding and control
	of MHD stability in tokamak plasmas. Sawteeth are anticipated in
	the ITER baseline ELMy H-mode scenario, but the tools exist to avoid
	or control them through localized current drive or fast ion generation.
	Active control of other MHD instabilities will most likely be also
	required in ITER. Extrapolation from existing experiments indicates
	that stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes by highly localized
	feedback-controlled current drive should be possible in ITER. Resistive
	wall modes are a key issue for advanced scenarios, but again, existing
	experiments indicate that these modes can be stabilized by a combination
	of plasma rotation and direct feedback control with non-axisymmetric
	coils. Reduction of error fields is a requirement for avoiding non-rotating
	magnetic island formation and for maintaining plasma rotation to
	help stabilize resistive wall modes. Recent experiments have shown
	the feasibility of reducing error fields to an acceptable level by
	means of non-axisymmetric coils, possibly controlled by feedback.
	The MHD stability limits associated with advanced scenarios are becoming
	well understood theoretically, and can be extended by tailoring of
	the pressure and current density profiles as well as by other techniques
	mentioned here. There have been significant advances also in the
	control of disruptions, most notably by injection of massive quantities
	of gas, leading to reduced halo current fractions and a larger fraction
	of the total thermal and magnetic energy dissipated by radiation.
	These advances in disruption control are supported by the development
	of means to predict impending disruption, most notably using neural
	networks. In addition to these advances in means to control or ameliorate
	the consequences of MHD instabilities, there has been significant
	progress in improving physics understanding and modelling. This progress
	has been in areas including the mechanisms governing NTM growth and
	seeding, in understanding the damping controlling RWM stability and
	in modelling RWM feedback schemes. For disruptions there has been
	continued progress on the instability mechanisms that underlie various
	classes of disruption, on the detailed modelling of halo currents
	and forces and in refining predictions of quench rates and disruption
	power loads. Overall the studies reviewed in this chapter demonstrate
	that MHD instabilities can be controlled, avoided or ameliorated
	to the extent that they should not compromise ITER operation, though
	they will necessarily impose a range of constraints.},

	unfavourable ion B × ? B configuration. The power threshold for the
	L?I transition is higher than scalings for the L?H transition with
	favourable drift, and increases with plasma current as well as density.
	Threshold conditions for the I?H transition are more variable. In
	some conditions I-mode is maintained up to the maximum available
	ICRF power of 5 MW, nearly a factor of two above the L?I threshold,
	giving a robust operating window. Edge T e at the L?I transition
	is in the range 250?450 eV, over a range of current and density,
	about a factor of two higher than with favourable drift, while at
	the I?H transition it can be much higher (up to 1.1 keV) but is again
	widely variable. Heat pulses due to sawteeth may play a role in transitions.
	Controlled I?L back transitions indicate little power hysteresis.},

	pedestals, which are associated with edge transport barrier (ETB)

	scales as the square of plasma current in both H-modes without edge-localized
	modes, and in the near scrape-off layer in Ohmic discharges. In either
	case, the pressure gradient obtained, normalized to the square of
	plasma current, is a function of local collisionality, hinting that
	common physics may contribute to setting profile gradients in both
	confinement regimes. Varying the neutral fuelling source has little
	effect on density gradient scale lengths in the ETB and a relatively
	weak impact on the height of the density pedestal, even during aggressive
	deuterium puffing. Strong screening of neutrals in the ETB are observed,
	creating a challenge for fuelling H-modes in C-Mod beyond their 'natural'
	density. A simple pedestal fuelling model does not reproduce the
	typically clamped density gradients seen in experiment during H-mode

	normalized energy confinement time H 98 â¥ 1) in H-mode and its
	relation to H-mode threshold power scaling, P th , are of critical
	importance to ITER. In order to better characterize these power requirements,
	recent experiments on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak have investigated
	H-mode properties, including the edge pedestal and global confinement,
	over a range of input powers near and above P th . In addition, we
	have examined the compatibility of impurity seeding with high performance
	operation, and the influence of plasma radiation and its spatial
	distribution on performance. Experiments were performed at 5.4 T
	at ITER relevant densities, utilizing bulk metal plasma facing surfaces
	and an ion cyclotron range of frequency waves for auxiliary heating.
	Input power was scanned both in stationary enhanced D Î± (EDA) H-modes
	with no large edge localized modes (ELMs) and in ELMy H-modes in
	order to relate the resulting pedestal and confinement to the amount
	of power flowing into the scrape-off layer, P net , and also to the
	divertor targets. In both EDA and ELMy H-mode, energy confinement
	is generally good, with H 98 near unity. As P net is reduced to levels
	approaching that in L-mode, pedestal temperature diminishes significantly
	and normalized confinement time drops. By seeding with low- Z impurities,
	such as Ne and N 2 , high total radiated power fractions are possible,
	along with substantial reductions in divertor heat flux (>4Ã), all
	while maintaining H 98 ~ 1. When the power radiated from the confined
	versus unconfined plasma is examined, pedestal and confinement properties
	are clearly seen to be an increasing function of P net , helping
	to unify the results with those from unseeded H-modes. This provides
	increased confidence that the power flow across the separatrix is
	the correct physics basis for ITER extrapolation. The experiments
	show that P net / P th of one or greater is likely to lead to H 98
	â¥ 1 operation, and also that such a condition can be made compatible
	with a low- Z radiative impurity solution for reducing divertor heat
	loads to levels acceptable for ITER.},

	predictive modelling of the edge pedestal in various high-confinement
	regimes, contributing to greater confidence in projection of pedestal
	height and width in ITER and reactors. ELMy H-modes operate near
	stability limits for ideal peeling?ballooning modes, as shown by
	calculations with the ELITE code. Experimental pedestal width in
	ELMy H-mode scales as the square root of ? pol at the pedestal top,
	i.e. the dependence expected from theory if kinetic ballooning modes
	(KBMs) were responsible for limiting the pedestal width. A search
	for KBMs in experiment has revealed a short-wavelength electromagnetic
	fluctuation in the pedestal that is a candidate driver for inter-edge
	localized mode (ELM) pedestal regulation. A predictive pedestal model
	(EPED) has been tested on an extended set of ELMy H-modes from C-Mod,
	reproducing pedestal height and width reasonably well across the
	data set, and extending the tested range of EPED to the highest absolute
	pressures available on any existing tokamak and to within a factor
	of three of the pedestal pressure targeted for ITER. In addition,
	C-Mod offers access to two regimes, enhanced D-alpha (EDA) H-mode
	and I-mode, that have high pedestals, but in which large ELM activity
	is naturally suppressed and, instead, particle and impurity transport
	are regulated continuously. Pedestals of EDA H-mode and I-mode discharges
	are found to be ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stable with ELITE,
	consistent with the general absence of ELM activity. Invocation of
	alternative physics mechanisms may be required to make EPED-like
	predictions of pedestals in these kinds of intrinsically ELM-suppressed
	regimes, which would be very beneficial to operation in burning plasma
	devices.},

	due to finite aspect ratio effects included only in TGLF. The synergistic
	effects of density peaking, finite β and E × B shear due to finite

	a reduced physics ITER base case. The TGLF results for ITER are confirmed
	using nonlinear GYRO simulations in place of TGLF to predict the

  abstract = {Plasma profiles and flows in the low- and high-field side scrape-off-layer
	(SOL) regions in Alcator C-Mod are found to be remarkably sensitive
	to magnetic separatrix topologies (upper-, lower- and double-null)
	and to impose topology-dependent flow boundary conditions on the
	confined plasma. Near-sonic plasma flows along magnetic field lines
	are observed in the high-field SOL, with magnitude and direction
	clearly dependent on X-point location. The principal drive mechanism
	for the flows is a strong ballooning-like poloidal transport asymmetry:
	parallel flows arise so as to re-symmetrize the resulting poloidal
	pressure variation in the SOL. Secondary flows involving a combination
	of toroidal rotation and Pfirsch?Schlüter ion currents are also evident.
	As a result of the transport-driven parallel flows, the SOL exhibits
	a net co-current (counter-current) volume-averaged toroidal momentum
	when B × ? B is towards (away from) the X-point. Depending on the
	discharge conditions, flow momentum can couple across the separatrix
	and affect the toroidal rotation of the confined plasma. This mechanism
	accounts for a positive (negative) increment in central plasma co-rotation
	seen in L-mode discharges when B × ? B is towards (away from) the
	X-point. Experiments in ion-cyclotron range-of-frequency-heated discharges
	suggest that topology-dependent flow boundary conditions may also
	play a role in the sensitivity of the L?H power threshold to X-point
	location: in a set of otherwise similar discharges, the L?H transition
	is seen to be coincident with central rotation achieving roughly
	the same value, independent of magnetic topology. For discharges
	with B × ? B pointing away from the X-point (i.e. with the SOL flow
	boundary condition impeding co-current rotation), the same characteristic
	rotation can only be achieved with higher input power.},

  abstract = {The build-up of plasma parameters following the H-mode transition
	in JET has been analysed in view of its consequences for the alpha
	power evolution in the access to burning plasma conditions in ITER.
	JET experiments show that the build-up of plasma temperature both
	at the plasma core and the plasma edge occurs in timescales comparable
	to the energy confinement time. In contrast, the evolution of the
	edge and core densities differs strongly depending on the level of
	plasma current in the discharge and of the associated NBI penetration.
	For higher plasma current H-mode discharges ( I p > 2.0–2.5 MA, depending
	on plasma shape), with naturally higher plasma densities for which
	NBI penetration is poorer, the core density evolves in much longer
	timescales than the edge density leading to the formation of rather
	hollow density profiles. These hollow density profiles persist for
	timescales of several energy confinement times until they are usually
	terminated by a sawtooth. Modelling of the JET experiments with JETTO
	shows that the density build-up following the H-mode transition can
	be described with a purely diffusive model, despite the low collisionalities
	of high current H-mode plasmas at JET. The consequences of these
	JET experimental/modelling findings for the access to burning plasma
	conditions in the ITER Q DT = 10 scenario are presented.},

	refinement in the predictions for ITER with plasma edge modelling
	codes by inclusion of detailed geometrical features of the divertor
	and the introduction of physical effects, which can play a major

	conditions such as hydrogen radiation transport and neutral?neutral
	collisions, modelling of the ion orbits at the plasma edge, which
	can play a role in determining power deposition at the divertor target,
	models for plasma?materials and plasma dynamics interaction during
	ELMs and disruptions, models for the transport of impurities at the
	plasma edge to describe the core contamination by impurities and
	the migration of eroded materials at the edge plasma and its associated

  abstract = {Under most operational conditions of Alcator C-Mod, the dominant type
	of H-mode is the steady state enhanced D Î± (EDA) mode, characterized
	by good energy confinement, continuously degraded impurity confinement
	and absence of regular edge localized modes (ELMs). In this regime,
	a quasicoherent (QC) electromagnetic mode ( k Î¸ ~5Â cm -1 , f ~100Â kHz)
	is observed, localized in the region of the density pedestal. Experimental
	evidence suggests that the mode is responsible for enhancement of
	particle transport. It is shown experimentally that the QC mode can
	exist in a well defined region in edge temperature-safety factor
	space, favouring high edge q values ( q 95 â¥3.5) and requiring
	moderate pedestal temperature T e ped â¤ T c ( T c ~400Â eV). As
	edge temperature and pressure gradient increase, the QC mode is replaced
	by broadband low frequency fluctuations ( f <50Â kHz). Small grassy
	ELMs are observed in these discharges. Analysis of ideal ballooning
	stability of the C-Mod edge shows that the edge pressure gradient
	is not limited by infinite n ideal ballooning mode if edge bootstrap
	current, even reduced by high edge collisionality, is taken into
	account. Linear stability analysis of coupled ideal peeling/ballooning
	medium n modes, driven by combination of edge pressure and current
	gradients, shows that the modes become marginally unstable at C-Mod
	edge in the range of pressure gradients where the grassy ELMs are
	observed (â P â¥1.2Ã10 7Â PaÂ Wb -1Â rad). This result is consistent
	with a model of the ELMs as intermediate n peeling/ballooning modes.
	On the other hand, demonstrated stability of the ideal modes in EDA
	regime, together with the fact that low T e ped is required for its
	existence, supports theoretical models showing resistive character
	of the QC mode.},

	For ohmic L-mode discharges with good core LH wave absorption, and

	( r / a < 0.5) rotation increments (on a time scale of order the

	fraction, unifying the results observed on various tokamaks. For
	high density ( n e ⩾ 1.2 × 10 20 m −3 ) L-mode target discharges,

	by the LH waves absorbed in the plasma periphery. The H-mode counter-rotation
	increment, a flattening of the peaked velocity profile in the core,
	is consistent with a reduction in the momentum pinch correlated with
	a steepening of the core density profile. Most of these rotation
	changes must be due to indirect transport effects of LH waves on
	various parameters, which modify the momentum flux.},

  abstract = {We have analysed the edge stability of JET discharges with small edge
	localized modes (ELMs) using the high resolution Thomson scattering

	For the reference plasmas with large Type I ELMs we confirm the results
	from earlier analyses that the edge stability is limited by intermediate-
	n peelingâballooning modes with a relatively large radial extent.
	The double null configuration needed to replace Type I ELMs by smaller
	Type II ELMs considerably increases the stability against these modes
	while the stability against n = â ballooning modes is not affected.
	When this is combined with high collisionality (which is the other
	requirement for Type II ELMs), we find that the plasma cannot reach
	the Type I ELM triggering peelingâballooning mode stability boundary
	before it is destabilized by high- n ballooning modes resulting in
	more benign ELMs. The ELM mitigation by magnetic perturbation causes
	the edge stability to be limited by pure peeling modes with a narrow
	radial extent. This explains the smaller ELM size and also why the
	ELMs are not fully suppressed. The transition from Type I ELMs to
	Type III ELMs by increasing the edge radiation fully stabilizes the
	edge plasma against ideal MHD modes. Therefore, the Type III ELMs
	are due to be triggered by some other mechanism than an ideal MHD
	instability.},

	experiments with resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) fields are
	presented. This comparison of resistive L-mode plasmas at TEXTOR
	with highly conductive H-mode plasmas at DIII-D is useful to identify
	generic physics mechanisms during application of RMP fields with
	a strong field line pitch angle alignment in the plasma edge. A reduction
	in the pedestal electron pressure p e with increasing extension of
	the vacuum modelled stochastic layer and p e recovery with decreasing
	layer width is found caused by a q 95 resonant reduction in the edge
	(0.8 < Ψ N < 0.95) electron temperature T e ( q 95 ) on both devices.
	For RMP edge-localized mode (ELM) suppressed H-mode plasmas at DIII-D,
	the gradients ∇ T e and nominal values of T e are reduced in this
	edge region while increasing in the pedestal (0.95 < Ψ N < 1.0) with
	RMP field applied and both are highly dependent on q 95 . In contrast,
	an increase in the central ion temperature with strong steepening
	of the ion temperature profile at mid-radius is found—again being
	highly dependent on q 95 . However, these resonant thermal transport
	effects are only seen in high triangularity plasmas revealing a strong
	shape dependence of the thermal transport. In contrast to the highly
	q 95 dependent thermal transport features, the reduction of n e —known
	as density pump out—shows a much weaker dependence on q 95 . We show
	the potential to reduce the RMP induced particle pump out by fine
	tuning of the RMP spectral properties. At low resonant field amplitudes
	enhanced particle confinement is seen in high-field side limited
	L-mode discharges on both devices while higher resonant field amplitudes
	yield particle pumps out.},

  abstract = {The pressure at the top of the edge transport barrier (or 'pedestal
	height') strongly impacts fusion performance, while large edge localized
	modes (ELMs), driven by the free energy in the pedestal region, can
	constrain material lifetimes. Accurately predicting the pedestal
	height and ELM behavior in ITER is an essential element of prediction
	and optimization of fusion performance. Investigation of intermediate
	wavelength MHD modes (or 'peelingâballooning' modes) has led to
	an improved understanding of important constraints on the pedestal
	height and the mechanism for ELMs. The combination of high-resolution
	pedestal diagnostics, including substantial recent improvements,
	and a suite of highly efficient stability codes, has made edge stability
	analysis routine on several major tokamaks, contributing both to
	understanding, and to experimental planning and performance optimization.
	Here we present extensive comparisons of observations to predicted
	edge stability boundaries on several tokamaks, both for the standard
	(Type I) ELM regime, and for small ELM and ELM-free regimes. We further
	discuss a new predictive model for the pedestal height and width
	(EPED1), developed by self-consistently combining a simple width
	model with peelingâballooning stability calculations. This model
	is tested against experimental measurements, and used in initial
	predictions of the pedestal height for ITER.},

	of the tokamak concept. The peelingâballooning model has quantitatively
	explained many observations, including ELM onset and pedestal constraints,
	in the standard H-mode regime. The ELITE code has been developed
	to efficiently evaluate peelingâballooning stability for comparison
	with observation and predictions for future devices. We briefly review
	recent progress in the peelingâballooning model, including experimental
	validation of ELM onset and pedestal height predictions, and nonlinear
	3D simulations of ELM dynamics, which together lead to an emerging
	understanding of the physics of the onset and dynamics of ELMs in
	the standard intermediate to high collisionality regime. We also
	discuss new studies of the apparent power dependence of the pedestal,
	and studies of the impact of sheared toroidal flow. Recently, highly
	promising low collisionality regimes without ELMs have been discovered,
	including the quiescent H-mode (QH) and resonant magnetic perturbation
	(RMP) regimes. We present recent observations from the DIII-D tokamak
	of the density, shape and rotation dependence of QH discharges, and
	studies of the peelingâballooning stability in this regime. We
	propose a model of the QH-mode in which the observed edge harmonic
	oscillation (EHO) is a saturated kink/peeling mode which is destabilized
	by current and rotation, and drives significant transport, allowing
	a near steady-state edge plasma. The model quantitatively predicts
	the observed density dependence and qualitatively predicts observed
	mode structure, rotation dependence and outer gap dependence. Low

  abstract = {The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability limits for the edge
	transport barrier (ETB) region in tokamaks are explored, concentrating
	in particular on the intermediate to high toroidal mode number, n
	, modes. These calculations take full account of the effect of the
	edge bootstrap current on the stability of both ballooning and peeling
	modes. Because the current plays an important role in MHD stability,
	the temperature and density independently influence stability and,
	in particular, the pressure gradient that the ETB can support. The
	stability calculations therefore provide limits to the achievable
	temperature pedestal associated with the transport barrier which
	are not simply pressure pedestal limits, as is often assumed. One
	important result is that increasing triangularity is predicted to
	be beneficial in providing access to a higher temperature pedestal
	at fixed pedestal width, at least up to triangularity ~0.5. Another
	significant result is that the finite n corrections, which are stabilizing
	for ballooning modes, are important for narrow pedestal widths and
	permit significantly higher temperature pedestals than one would
	obtain using the leading order ( n = ∞) ballooning theory. Specific
	calculations for equilibria characteristic of ITER and FIRE suggest
	that temperature pedestals in the region of a few kiloelectronvolts
	should be achievable, but the precise value depends on the pedestal

	is emerging ( Snyder P B et al [/0741-3335/45/10/002] 2002 Phys.
	Plasmas 9 2037 ), in which the ELM is an essentially ideal magnetohydrodynamic
	(MHD) instability and the ELM severity is determined by the radial
	width of the linearly unstable MHD kink modes. A detailed, comparative
	study of the penetration into the core of the respective linear instabilities
	in a standard DIII-D ELMing, high confinement mode (H-mode) discharge,
	with that for two relatively high performance discharges shows that
	these are also encompassed within the framework of the new model.
	These instabilities represent the key limiting factor in extending
	the high performance of these discharges. In the standard ELMing
	H-mode, the MHD instabilities are highly localized in the outer few
	per cent flux surfaces, and the ELM is benign, causing only a small
	temporary drop in the energy confinement. In contrast, for both a
	very high confinement mode and an H-mode with a broad internal transport
	barrier extending over the entire core and coalesced with the edge
	transport barrier, the linearly unstable modes penetrate well into
	the mid radius and the corresponding consequences for global confinement
	are significantly more severe. The ELM accordingly results in an
	irreversible loss of the high performance. This article was due to

  abstract = {Characteristics of edge-localized mode (ELM) energy and particle losses
	in type-I ELMy H-mode plasmas on ASDEX Upgrade are investigated by
	a large data set with as much as possible independent variations
	in engineering parameters. A statistically unbiased estimate for
	ELM energy and particle losses has been employed to remove the diagnostic
	noise as much as possible. The data set shows that the ELM energy
	loss decreases with the pedestal density or collisionality. However,
	the role of plasma shape, especially, triangularity, as an explicit
	parameter is revealed. Elevated triangularity leads to lower ELM
	frequency and larger ELM energy loss significantly exceeding that
	simply expected from the increased pedestal pressure in high triangularity
	plasmas at a fixed power. The observed larger ELM energy drop at
	higher triangularity involves the ELM perturbations of the electron
	temperature profile across an ELM that extend radially more inward,
	suggesting that there is a direct effect of plasma shape on ELM energy
	losses. It is found that the fraction of ELM loss power does not
	remain constant but the increased pedestal collisionality enhances
	the transport level between ELMs and reduces the ELM loss power.
	The ELM particle flux at fixed power rises with increasing gas fuelling
	rate. On the other hand, at fixed gas puff, an inverse proportionality
	between ELM frequency and ELM particle loss roughly holds despite
	of a large variation of power. When the particle flux near the separatrix
	is enhanced, the increase of ELM frequency and the reduction of ELM
	loss power caused by the increased collisionality lead to the reduction
	of ELM energy loss so that the energy balance could be sustained.},

	Alcator C-Mod, plasmas with T e (0) up to 8Â keV are obtained using
	ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH), ICRF mode conversion heating
	and a combination of the two heating methods in order to explore
	the hypothesis that the presence of ICRH-generated fast ions may
	be related to the discrepancy. In all high temperature cases, the
	TS and ECE measurements of electron temperature agree to within experimental
	uncertainties. We find no evidence for the type of discrepancy reported
	at JET and TFTR. These results show that the TS-ECE discrepancy does

  abstract = {An improved energy confinement regime, I-mode, is studied in Alcator
	C-Mod, a compact high-field divertor tokamak using ion cyclotron
	range of frequencies (ICRFs) auxiliary heating. I-mode features an
	edge energy transport barrier without an accompanying particle barrier,
	leading to several performance benefits. H-mode energy confinement
	is obtained without core impurity accumulation, resulting in reduced
	impurity radiation with a high- Z metal wall and ICRF heating. I-mode
	has a stationary temperature pedestal with edge localized modes typically
	absent, while plasma density is controlled using divertor cryopumping.
	I-mode is a confinement regime that appears distinct from both L-mode
	and H-mode, combining the most favourable elements of both. The I-mode
	regime is investigated predominately with ion ? B drift away from
	the active X-point. The transition from L-mode to I-mode is primarily
	identified by the formation of a high temperature edge pedestal,
	while the edge density profile remains nearly identical to L-mode.
	Laser blowoff injection shows that I-mode core impurity confinement
	times are nearly identical with those in L-mode, despite the enhanced
	energy confinement. In addition, a weakly coherent edge MHD mode
	is apparent at high frequency ~100?300 kHz which appears to increase
	particle transport in the edge. The I-mode regime has been obtained
	over a wide parameter space ( B T = 3?6 T, I p = 0.7?1.3 MA, q 95
	= 2.5?5). In general, the I-mode exhibits the strongest edge temperature
	pedestal ( T ped ) and normalized energy confinement ( H 98 > 1)
	at low q 95 ( 4 MW). I-mode significantly expands the operational
	space of edge localized mode (ELM)-free, stationary pedestals in
	C-Mod to T ped ~ 1 keV and low collisionality ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/50/10/105005/nf358845in001.gif]
