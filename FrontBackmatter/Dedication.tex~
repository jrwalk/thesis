    Dedicated to the all of the teachers in my life. \\ From my formal education in Rossman Elementary School, \\ Central Middle School, Hartford Union High School, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology \\ to everyone who taught me something out in the real world. \\ I am who I am today thanks to you. \\ For that, I am forever grateful.
