\chapter*{Publications}
%    It is often the style in the American PhD system to write a thesis and turn it into papers. I, however, favor more of a European approach where I write papers and then turn them into a PhD thesis. This has at least two advantages:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item The work is guaranteed to be available to the greater scientific community in an easily accessible, peer-reviewed format (although, I must confess that having Brian as a coauthor was the most rigorous peer-reviewing that I received).
%        \item It takes most of the work of thesis writing and spreads it out over the years of work, instead of piling it all up at the end.
%    \end{enumerate}
    The content in this thesis is comprised primarily of the 7 journal articles listed below. Some of it being word-for-word identical. However, I have gone to some effort to reorganize the content into a coherent body rather than simply writing a boiler plate introduction \& conclusion and then staple them together with the papers. I have also added additional content and details where I felt it added to the story.
