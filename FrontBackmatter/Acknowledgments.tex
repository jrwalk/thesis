\note{intro paragraph}

This thesis would have been utterly impossible without the support of my committee.  First, I wish to thank my advisor, Dr. Jerry Hughes -- a man who combines experimental acumen and good humor, and who has proven an excellent mentor for research.  I look forward to working with him in the future.  I am no less grateful to Prof. Dennis Whyte, the reader of this thesis.  He has been a constant source of insight, particularly in the ``big picture'' for fusion research.  The committee was rounded out by Prof. Anne White, who (among her many contributions) deserves recognition for her constant support of student efforts on C-Mod and in the NSE department here at MIT.

A number of other scientists merit special mention as well.  First, Phil Snyder of General Atomics, whose theoretical work and development of the ELITE and EPED codes contributed much to the analysis presented in this thesis.  He possesses a rare gift for connecting the esoterics of theory to the vagaries of experiment.  Amanda Hubbard is due thanks for her tireless work in I-mode experiments, and for her perpetually open door for the many questions I had during this thesis.

The experimental work in this thesis was completed on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, a DOE Office of Science user facility.  Work at Alcator C-Mod is supported by US DOE agreement No. DE-FC02-99ER54512.  Theory work at General Atomics is supported by US DOE agreement No. DE-FG02-99ER54309.
