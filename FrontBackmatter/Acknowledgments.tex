\note{intro paragraph}

This thesis would have been utterly impossible without the support of my committee.  First, I wish to thank my advisor, Dr. Jerry Hughes -- a man who combines experimental acumen and good humor, and who has proven an excellent mentor for research.  I look forward to working with him in the future.  I am no less grateful to Prof. Dennis Whyte, the reader of this thesis.  He has been a constant source of insight, particularly in the ``big picture'' for fusion research.  The committee was rounded out by Prof. Anne White, who (among her many talents) deserves recognition for her constant support of student efforts on C-Mod and in the NSE department.

The experimental work in this thesis was completed on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, a DOE Office of Science user facility.  Work at Alcator C-Mod is supported by US DOE agreement No. DE-FC02-99ER54512.  Theory work at General Atomics is supported by US DOE agreement No. DE-FG02-99ER54309.
