\chapter{Diagnostics}\label{app:Diagnostics}

The dedicated pedestal experiments, both in I-mode and ELMy H-mode, presented here required an extensive suite of diagnostics to characterize pedestal behavior.  Broadly, these diagnostics may be grouped in three categories:

\begin{description}
 \item[Thomson Scattering] \hfill \\
 Details the edge Thomson scattering diagnostic, from which the high-resolution profile data used for the bulk of this thesis was gathered.
 \item[Sawtooth and ELM Tracking] \hfill \\
 Details the Electron-Cyclotron Emission (ECE) and $H_\alpha$ line radiation diagnostics used to track sawtooth crashes and ELM events in the plasma edge.
 \item[Fluctuation Diagnostics] \hfill \\
 Details Gas-Puff Imaging (GPI), Reflectometry, and other diagnostics used to characterize the mid-frequency fluctuations found in I-mode pedestals.
\end{description}
