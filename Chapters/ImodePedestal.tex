\chapter{I-Mode Pedestal Scalings}\label{ch:ImodePedestal}

The I-mode \cite{Whyte2010,Hubbard2011}, introduced in \cref{sec:hcr_imode}, is a novel high-performance regime pioneered on Alcator C-Mod.  I-mode is unique in that it appears to decouple energy and particle transport, forming a steep temperature pedestal with H-mode levels of energy confinement without the accompanying density pedestal or suppression of particle transport found in conventional H-modes.  I-mode exhibits several highly attractive properties for a putative reactor regime:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Due to the lack of particle transport suppression (as is found in H-modes), the I-mode retains L-mode-like impurity confinement times, avoiding the accumulation of deleterious impurities in the plasma, including those from high-$Z$ metal plasma-facing components necessary for reactor operation \cite{Loarte2007}.  This ensures stationary operation without the need for ELMs or continuous fluctuations in the edge to provide the necessary relaxation of the particle confinement.
 \item I-mode appears to be naturally stable against large ELMs, avoiding excessive pulsed heat loading to plasma-facing components without externally-applied engineering controls (described in \cref{subsec:hcr_elmy_control}).
 \item Energy confinement in I-mode appears to exhibit little to know degradation with input heating power, in contrast to that found in ELMy H-mode ($\tau_E \sim P^{-0.7}$ from the ITER98y2 analysis \cite{ITER1999}), scaling quite favorably to reactor-scale devices.
\end{enumerate}

A firm understanding of the pedestal is essential for the extrapolation of any high-performance regime to ITER- and reactor-scale devices.  The pedestal height sets a strong constraint on core temperature and pressure -- and therefore overall fusion performance -- both by acting as a boundary condition for the plasma profiles, and by supporting steeper core temperature gradients due to profile stiffness \cite{Kinsey2011,Hubbard1998}.  Moreover, the pedestal structure, particularly the steep gradients in density, temperature, and/or pressure, determines stability of the plasma against large, deleterious ELMs (see \cref{sec:mod_pb}).  In this chapter, we review empirical observations of the pedestal in I-mode from a recent series of dedicated experiments, with a focus on high-resolution pedestal profile measurements across a range of plasma parameters.  Through this, we examine trends in I-mode pedestal behavior, and their impact on global behavior and performance in I-mode, and possible extrapolations to larger devices\gnote{be more specific... maybe?}.\nicesectionending

\section{Access and Experimental Setup}\label{sec:imode_setup}

All data presented here was taken on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, described in \cref{sec:intro_cmod}.  As described in \cref{subsec:hcr_imode_access}, I-mode access hinges primarily on operation with the ion $\nabla B$ drift (\cref{eq:gradbdrift}) directed away from the primary X-point in the plasma (the ``unfavorable $\nabla B$ drift'' configuration).  Within this requirement, though, I-mode access is fairly robust, with steady I-modes sustained in a variety of shapes -- both USN with standard field, and LSN shapes with reversed field to achieve the desired $\nabla B$ drift direction (in the latter case, the plasma current is reversed as well to preserve field helicity) -- and edge-current profiles, and at low-to-moderate collisionality.\gnote{ref to nustar definition}
