\chapter{I-Mode Pedestal Stability Modeling}\label{ch:ImodeModeling}

Large, uncontrolled Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs -- see \cref{sec:hcr_elmy}) in ITER-scale operation are expected to drive unacceptable levels of pulsed heat loading and erosion damage to plasma-facing materials \cite{Loarte2003,Federici2003}.  As such, avoiding or mitigating large ELMs is a major focus of research in high-performance regimes: approaches include active ELM control in H-mode (\cref{subsec:hcr_elmy_control}) and inherently ELM-suppressed regimes (\cref{sec:hcr_elmsuppressed}).  To these we add the I-mode (\cref{sec:hcr_imode}), which appears to be naturally stable against large, deleterious ELMs in addition to its other beneficial properties (see \cref{ch:ImodePedestal}).

Confidence in plans for high-performance operation on ITER- and reactor-scale devices requires a predictive model for the pedestal structure and stability, to optimize fusion performance and ELM control or avoidance.  Recent cooperative efforts among theory, modeling, and experiment \cite{Groebner2013} have resulted in such a model for ELMy H-modes, termed EPED \cite{Snyder2009,Snyder2011}, detailed in \cref{sec:mod_eped}.  The EPED model combines constraints from peeling-ballooning MHD stability (\cref{sec:mod_pb}) \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2004,Wilson2006}\gnote{cites?} and kinetic-ballooning turbulence (\cref{sec:mod_turbulence}) \cite{Snyder1999,Candy2005,Snyder2001}.  The EPED model has been successfully implemented in ELMy H-mode on a number of machines, including DIII-D \cite{Snyder2009,Snyder2011}, JT-60U \cite{Snyder2009}, C-Mod \cite{Walk2012}, and KSTAR \cite{Han2013}, as well as in QH-mode \cite{Snyder2012}; small/no-ELM regimes (EDA H-mode, type-II and type-III ELMy H-modes) have been shown to be stable against the drive identified in the EPED model \cite{Snyder2009}.

In this chapter, we apply the EPED approach to I-mode, examining the stability of the I-mode pedestal against peeling-ballooning MHD and kinetic-ballooning turbulence \cite{Walk2014}.  This is compared to the observed lack of large ELMs in I-mode, with a goal of examining the parameter space in which ELM-free stationary operation with I-mode is possible.  We also examine the stability and edge behavior of cases in which small, intermittent ELM-like events are observed in I-mode.\nicesectionending

The I-mode pedestal is observed to be far from both the peeling and ballooning MHD stability boundaries.}\label{fig:imode_elite_noelm}}
\end{figure}

The triggering of large ELMs in H-mode has been identified with the interaction between pressure-driven ballooning and current-driven edge kink/peeling MHD instabilities (the latter is typically referred to as a ``peeling'' mode to distinguish it from similarly current-driven core kink modes) in the pedestal \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2004,Wilson2006}.  Numerical studies of these instabilities using the ELITE code \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2003}, detailed in \cref{subsec:mod_elite}, have proven quite successful in capturing the physics of the ELM trigger.

An ELITE calculation for the I-mode pedestal is shown in \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm}, along with parameters (line-averaged density, core and edge $T_e$, global-average pressure, and $H_\alpha$ emission) for the modeled phase of the discharge.
