\chapter{I-Mode Pedestal Stability Modeling}\label{ch:ImodeModeling}

Large, uncontrolled Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs -- see \cref{sec:hcr_elmy}) in ITER-scale operation are expected to drive unacceptable levels of pulsed heat loading and erosion damage to plasma-facing materials \cite{Loarte2003,Federici2003}.  As such, avoiding or mitigating large ELMs is a major focus of research in high-performance regimes: approaches include active ELM control in H-mode (\cref{subsec:hcr_elmy_control}) and inherently ELM-suppressed regimes (\cref{sec:hcr_elmsuppressed}).  To these we add the I-mode (\cref{sec:hcr_imode}), which appears to be naturally stable against large, deleterious ELMs in addition to its other beneficial properties (see \cref{ch:ImodePedestal}).

Confidence in plans for high-performance operation on ITER- and reactor-scale devices requires a predictive model for the pedestal structure and stability, to optimize fusion performance and ELM control or avoidance.  Recent cooperative efforts among theory, modeling, and experiment \cite{Groebner2013} have resulted in such a model for ELMy H-modes, termed EPED \cite{Snyder2009,Snyder2011}, detailed in \cref{sec:mod_eped}.  The EPED model combines constraints from peeling-ballooning MHD stability (\cref{sec:mod_pb}) \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2004,Wilson2006} and kinetic-ballooning turbulence (\cref{sec:mod_turbulence}) \cite{Snyder1999,Candy2005,Snyder2001}.  The EPED model has been used to successfully predict the pedestal in ELMy H-mode on a number of machines, including DIII-D \cite{Snyder2009,Snyder2011}, JT-60U \cite{Snyder2009}, C-Mod \cite{Walk2012}, and KSTAR \cite{Han2013}, as well as in QH-mode \cite{Snyder2012}; small/no-ELM regimes (EDA H-mode, type-II and type-III ELMy H-modes) have been shown to be stable against the drive identified in the EPED model \cite{Snyder2009}.

In this chapter, we test the underlying physics assumptions from EPED in I-mode, examining the stability of the I-mode pedestal against peeling-ballooning MHD and kinetic-ballooning turbulence \cite{Walk2014}.  This is compared to the observed lack of large ELMs in I-mode, with a goal of examining the parameter space in which stationary ELM-free operation with I-mode is possible.  We also examine the stability and edge behavior of cases in which small, intermittent ELM-like events are observed in I-mode operation.\nicesectionending

\section{MHD Stability -- ELITE}\label{sec:imode_elite}

The triggering of large ELMs in H-mode has been identified with the interaction between pressure-driven ballooning and current-driven edge kink/peeling MHD instabilities (the latter is typically referred to as a ``peeling'' mode to distinguish it from similarly current-driven core kink modes) in the pedestal \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2004,Wilson2006}.  Numerical studies of these instabilities using the ELITE code \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2003}, detailed in \cref{subsec:mod_elite}, have proven quite successful in capturing the physics of the ELM trigger.

\subsection{ELITE Implementation}\label{subsec:imode_elite_setup}

At its simplest, a single pass in ELITE calculates the growth rate of the peeling-ballooning instability at fixed toroidal mode number $n$ for a given plasma profile (to wit, the pressure gradient and current density in the pedestal) and equilibrium \cite{Snyder2013}.  This requires a reconstructed magnetic equilibrium with sufficiently high point density to capture the rapid variation in flux surfaces near the edge -- all results in this chapter were prepared using high-resolution EFIT \cite{Lao1985} reconstructions constrained by kinetic profiles -- and high-resolution diagnostics to generate accurate profile measurements in the pedestal.  To fully capture the physics of the pedestal, however, it is beneficial to visualize the pedestal relative to the full stability boundary (see \cref{fig:mod_pbcartoon} for a schematic illustration), typically expressed in terms of the pressure-gradient and current-density drive terms.  

\begin{figure}[p]

The I-mode pedestal is observed to be far from both the peeling and ballooning MHD stability boundaries.}\label{fig:imode_elite_noelm}}
\end{figure}

Beginning from the experimental result, the profiles are scaled at fixed pedestal width, such that the pressure pedestal height or peak current density (with the current calculated by the Sauter formulation \cite{Sauter1999}) is increased or decreased relative to the original by a scalar factor, after which a self-consistent EFIT reconstruction is attempted.  This effectively fills in a grid in $\alpha_{MHD} - j$ space (a practice termed \emph{varyped}).  Horizontal slices represent a scaling of the pressure pedestal height (and therefore gradient) at fixed current, and vertical slices represent a scaling of the current density at fixed $\nabla p$.  While ELITE does not explicitly distinguish between density and temperature profiles, these slices implicitly vary density and temperature relative to each other.  For example, horizontal slices increase both density and temperature at roughly fixed $n_e/T_e^2$, such that collisionality is fixed, while vertical slices decrease pedestal density and increase temperature to preserve the pedestal pressure while decreasing collisionality, thereby increasing the bootstrap current (note that these trends are inexact, as the \emph{varyped} process attempts to generate self-consistent equilibria after scaling the pedestals in this fashion, which tends to skew the grid slightly).  Note that the practice described in \cref{sec:mod_eped} of increasing pressure (and pressure gradient) at fixed width to find the maximum ELM-stable pressure as a function of width is essentially a diagonal slice through the $\alpha_{MHD} - j$ grid: only the pressure profile is explicitly scaled, with the bootstrap current allowed to self-consistently vary, and will increase with increasing $\nabla p$.  At each point in the $\alpha_{MHD} - j$ grid, ELITE is run for a range of mode numbers (here $5 \le n \le 35$) to find the most unstable mode and its growth rate; this is normalized to diamagnetic stabilization effects by the threshold for instability onset, $\gamma_{MHD} > \omega_{*eff}/2$, where $\omega_{*eff}$ is the effective diamagnetic frequency accounting for variation in the pedestal, as implemented in EPED1.6 (see \cref{subsec:mod_eped16}).

\subsection{I-Mode ELITE Calculations}\label{subsec:imode_elite_calc}

An ELITE calculation for the I-mode pedestal is shown in \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm}, along with parameters (line-averaged density, core and edge $T_e$, global-average pressure, and $H_\alpha$ emission) for the modeled phase of the discharge.  The I-mode pedestal parameters, indicated by the yellow crosshair, are far from both the peeling and ballooning MHD stability boundaries calculated by ELITE (indicated by the yellow dashed line, marking the $\gamma/(\omega_{*eff}/2) = 1$ contour) -- compare this with the ELMy H-mode calculation shown in \cref{fig:elmy_elite}.  This is consistent with the observed lack of large ELMs, even in higher-performance I-modes (both in the normalized sense, with $H_{98} = 1.02$ and $\beta_N = 1.0$, and in absolute terms, $W_{MHD} = \SI{177}{\kilo\joule}$ in the case in \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm}, compared to $W \sim 100-\SI{120}{\kilo\joule}$ in ELMy H-mode and $W \sim 150-\SI{190}{\kilo\joule}$ in EDA H-mode).

\begin{figure}[h]

 \fcapside[60mm]{\caption[Pedestal profiles in I-mode and ELMy H-mode.]{Pedestal profiles in I-mode and ELMy H-mode.  Due to the steep density gradient in the pedestal, the H-mode exhibits significant pressure gradient and edge current density, which drive the peeling-ballooning MHD instability associated with the ELM trigger.  Despite this, the high edge temperature in I-mode allows it to reach an appreciable pedestal pressure.}\label{fig:imode_elmy_profs}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/IModeModeling/prof_elmy_imode.pdf}}
\end{figure}

The calculated MHD stability is intuitively understood from the I-mode pedestal profile: while the I-mode reaches comparable pedestal pressures to H-mode, the pressure is due largely to the strong temperature pedestal, with a relaxed density profile and broader pedestal width than comparable-$\beta_p$ H-modes.  This reduces the total pressure gradient (and thus the ballooning MHD drive), as well as the local bootstrap current (set largely by the density gradient) and peeling drive.  A comparison of the pedestal profiles, with pressure gradient and edge current density, between I-mode and H-mode is shown in \cref{fig:imode_elmy_profs}.  However, due to the strong interplay between the pressure gradient and bootstrap current (which is reduced by the lack of a density pedestal, but enhanced by the naturally low collisionality in I-mode), the full computational approach in ELITE is necessary to accurately characterize the pedestal stability.

This case exhibited small,intermittent ELM-like events, but is still calculated to be peeling-ballooning stable for profiles averaged over the time window.}\label{fig:imode_elite_stelm}}
\end{figure}

Although I-mode is free of the regular, large ELMs typical of (type-I) ELMy H-mode, under certain conditions -- particularly reduced toroidal field and plasma current -- small ($<1\%$ drop in stored energy) intermittent ELM-like events are occasionally observed in I-mode.  However, when examined in ELITE (\cref{fig:imode_elite_stelm}) these cases are found to still be far from the peeling-ballooning boundary.  These intermittent events occur in conjunction to sawtooth heat pulses reaching the edge, visible on the fast ECE $T_e$ signal, indicating that the events are potentially triggered by transient modification of the pedestal by the heat pulse -- however, these events are not consistently triggered on each sawtooth crash under similar conditions.  More study is required on this front, with initial results shown in \cref{sec:imode_elms}.

(a) Pedestal temperature vs. density for I-mode and ELMy H-mode.  Due to the poloidal-field normalization, hyperbolae in the parameter space are curves of constant $\beta_{p,ped}$.

Pedestal poloidal beta trends linearly with (normalized) density, rather than lying on the $\beta_{p,ped}$-limited line expected for MHD-limited pedestals, consistent with the strong response of the I-mode pedestal to fueling (see \cref{subsec:imode_fueling}).  I-mode data lie on a line of constant $T_e/B_p$, consistent with the observed $T_{e,ped} \sim I_p$ seen in \cref{subsec:imode_temp}.}\label{fig:neBp_stitch}}

\end{figure}

Examination of the I-mode pedestal is also illuminating from the perspective of MHD stability.  To lowest order approximation, MHD-limited pedestals, as are found in ELMy H-mode, are limited in the attainable poloidal beta at the pedestal top (a limit arising from the limit on $\alpha_{MHD}$ from ballooning instability coupled with the weakly-varying pedestal width on a given tokamak -- \cf \cref{subsec:hcr_elmy_fluct}).  This is illustrated in \cref{fig:neBp_stitch}(a), showing the pedestal density and temperature normalized to poloidal field (accounting for variation in plasma current).  Due to the normalization to $B_p$, hyperbolae in the parameter space are curves of constant pedestal $\beta_{p}$.  ELMy H-mode data lie on such a curve (note that, since the $\beta_p$ limit is shaping-dependent, only ELMy H-mode cases with approximately matched shape are shown on the single hyperbolic curve), with the expected inverse relationship between pedestal density and temperature.  I-mode pedestal density and temperature, on the other hand, are uncorrelated, consistent with the pedestal not being limited by MHD stability constraints.  I-mode pedestal pressure, similarly normalized, is shown against normalized pedestal density in \cref{fig:neBp_stitch}(b).  Where MHD-limited pedestals would show a flat trend due to the limit on poloidal beta, I-mode $\beta_p$ instead exhibits a linear trend with density.  This is consistent with the strong response of pedestal performance with increased fueling (described in \cref{ch:ImodePedestal}, particularly \cref{subsec:imode_fueling}) provided sufficient heating power to maintain the pedestal.  The slope of this trend is a line of constant $T_{e,95}/B_p$, consistent with the observed $T_e \sim I_p$ as well (see \cref{subsec:imode_temp}).  This trend in the normalized pressure is in addition to the response of pedestal pressure with heating power, as shown in \cref{fig:neBp_pBp_Pnebar}.  The temperature response to heating power is encoded in setting the slope of the fixed $T_{e,95}/B_p$ line, reflecting the higher temperatures at fixed current with increased $P_{net}/\overline{n}_e$.\nicesectionending

Due to the local nature of the infinite-$n$ constraint, BALOO calculates the width in flux space that is locally ballooning-critical -- when this reaches half of the pedestal width, the KBM is assumed to be triggered.  This case is near the KBM-predicted pedestal width $\Delta_{EPED}$, but is nevertheless modeled to be KBM-stable (for $\Delta_\psi \sim 0.02$, the half-width threshold is the white dotted contour labeled $0.01$).}\label{fig:imode_baloo_noelm}}

\end{figure}

Edge turbulence in I-mode is characterized by the strong reduction of mid-frequency turbulence corresponding to the reduced energy transport after the L-I transition.  Instead, the I-mode exhibits a broad higher-frequency ($200-400\;\si{\kilo\hertz}$) fluctuation, the \emph{Weakly-Coherent Mode} \cite{Whyte2010,Hubbard2011,Cziegler2013} (see \cref{subsec:hcr_imode_wcm}).  Due to its prominence in the I-mode edge and qualitative similarity to the Quasi-Coherent Mode (QCM) in EDA H-mode \cite{Hubbard2001} (see \cref{subsec:hcr_eda}), the WCM is thought to play a role in regulating the I-mode pedestal, particularly by driving enhanced particle flux \cite{Dominguez2012}.  While the WCM is fairly well-characterized experimentally, the underlying physics of the mode remain an open question.  From the standpoint of both turbulence characterization and ELM stability, the kinetic-ballooning mode (KBM) is a valuable starting point for comparing the WCM to the turbulent behavior in more conventional H-modes.

Computational modeling of the KBM is possible using infinite-$n$ ideal ballooning MHD as a surrogate for the turbulence threshold \cite{Snyder2001,Candy2005,Snyder2009} (see \cref{sec:mod_turbulence}).  The localized constraint from the KBM (and perfectly-localized infinite-$n$ ideal MHD) is applied to the entire pedestal via the ``ballooning-critical pedestal'' technique, described in \cref{subsec:mod_bcp}, in which the KBM threshold is identified as the point at which half of the pedestal (typically the ``middle half'' where the pressure gradient is steepest) is locally at or beyond criticality to the MHD surrogate.  This is calculated using the BALOO code \cite{Connor1979,Miller1987}; at each point in the \emph{varyped} grid, the number of rational surfaces that are unstable to infinite-$n$ ballooning modes and subsequently the width in poloidal flux space covered by these surfaces is calculated, drawing contours of pedestal half-width corresponding to the KBM threshold.

I-mode pedestals exhibit little trend in width (in poloidal flux space) with pedestal poloidal beta (see \cref{fig:imode_wid_betapol}), as would be expected for pedestals limited by KBM turbulence.  We may compare cases spanning the range in pedestal width $\Delta_\psi$ against the KBM-limited prediction for the width, $\Delta_\psi = 0.076 \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$, from EPED1 (see \cref{subsec:mod_eped1}), herein termed $\Delta_{EPED}$.  A representative case near the EPED1 prediction line is shown in \cref{fig:imode_baloo_noelm} (overlaid on the ELITE result for the same case, \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm}).  For $\Delta_\psi = .021$, the expected KBM threshold based on the BCP half-width calculation is the $0.01$ contour -- the pedestal is calculated to be stable compared to this threshold.  The representative case far from the EPED1 prediction line is shown in \cref{fig:imode_baloo_stelm} (overlaid on the ELITE result for the same case, \cref{fig:imode_elite_stelm}).  At $\Delta_\psi = 0.04$, the expected KBM threshold is the $0.02$ contour -- however, the BALOO assay could not calculate enough ballooning-unstable rational surfaces to even draw this contour.  Suffice to say that the pedestal is far from the KBM onset threshold as calculated from infinite-$n$ MHD.  Notably, the former case ($\Delta_\psi \sim \Delta_{EPED}$) was a relatively high-performance case, and did not exhibit ELM-like events, while the latter ($\Delta_\psi \gg \Delta_{EPED}$) exhibited ELM-like events.  The indication from both experimental observation (namely, the lack of dependence of the pedestal width on $\beta_{p,ped}$) and computational modeling, then, is that the KBM is not responsible for limiting the pedestal in I-mode.\nicesectionending

\section{Intermittent ELMs in I-Mode}\label{sec:imode_elms}

Given the importance of controlling or avoiding large ELMs on ITER- and reactor-scale devices, a firm understanding of the physics underlying the ELM trigger is essential for planned ITER operation.  While I-mode is typically observed to be naturally free of large, damaging ELMs, there are nevertheless a minority of cases -- twelve time windows comprised of ten unique shots, out of 72 windows (52 unique shots) total in the pedestal database -- under certain conditions (particularly, reduced current and toroidal field) in which small, intermittent ELMs or ELM-like events are observed.  It is to these cases that we now turn our attention.

Note that, to directly compare two separately-calculated equilibria, we replace the $\alpha_{MHD}$ and $j_\parallel$ axes with stability metrics arising from peeling and ballooning MHD.  While the sawtooth heat pulse does measureably perturb the pedestal in stability space, it is insufficient to reach either the peeling-ballooning or KBM threshold.}\label{fig:imode_stbin}}
\end{figure}

ELMs in I-mode are generally observed to be small ($<1\%$ perturbation to the stored energy), and are sporadic, rather than occurring in a regular cycle as in the conventional type-I ELMy H-mode.  The majority events occur shortly following the sawtooth heat pulse reaching the edge (26 sawtooth-triggered events in the studied windows, compared to 10 off of the sawtooth), based on timing from fast ECE $T_e$ measurements in the pedestal.  This indicates a possible trigger for the event due to transient modification of the pedestal structure.  An example case of this is shown in \cref{fig:prof_stbin}.  The sawtooth heat pulse does not perturb the density profile, but drives a significant transient increase in the temperature pedestal (data masked to the first 25\% of the sawtooth cycle after the heat pulse reaches the edge shown in red).  Calculations in ELITE and BALOO for this case are shown in \cref{fig:imode_stbin} for both the time-averaged pedestal profile, and the masked data to the sawtooth cycle.  While the sawtooth synchronization does drive a measurable perturbation to the pedestal in stability space -- the effect is predominantly in the pressure gradient, rather than the current density, due to the weaker effect of the temperature gradient on the bootstrap current -- the effect is insufficient to reach either the peeling-ballooning MHD or the KBM turbulence threshold (although the perturbed point nears the KBM threshold within errorbars, indicating that the KBM may still be a factor).  Note that, in order to compare two separately-computed equilibria, we use alternate axes in \cref{fig:imode_stbin}: rather than directly using $\alpha_{MHD}$ and the (normalized) edge current density, the parameter space is presented in terms of ballooning and kink-peeling stability parameters, $\beta_N/\Delta^{3/4}$ and $j_{max} \Delta^{1/4}$.  The first encapsulates the $p_{ped} \sim \Delta^{3/4}$ trend expected from ballooning stability, when accounting for the nonlocal effects -- at broader $\Delta$, wider low-$n$ modes destabilize more easily, reducing the maximum $\alpha_{MHD}$, as described in \cref{sec:mod_pb} -- and current stabilization.  The second accounts for the trend in the total current, $\int j \;d\psi \sim \Delta^{3/4}$ from the $p_{ped} \sim \Delta^{3/4}$ trend from ballooning stability, with the total edge bootstrap current set by the pedestal pressure; however, the maximum current density and total pedestal current may be related by $\int j \; d\psi \sim j_{max} \Delta \rightarrow j_{max} \sim 1/\Delta^{1/4}$, thus the current-driven kink/peeling stability may be expressed in terms of the normalized $j_{max} \Delta^{1/4}$.

ELMs in H-mode (visible on the $H_\alpha$ trace) are independent of the sawtooth cycle, and drive perturbations to the edge temperature and line-integrated density, as both energy and particles are expelled form the plasma by the ELM crash.  This is particularly clear on the edge temperature, which exhibits a clear increase with the sawtooth heat pulse and a separate crash with the ELM.  I-mode, in contrast, exhibits ELMs (or ELM-like events) that are tied to sawtooth heat pulses reaching the edge, as visible on the ECE $T_e$ signal.  No visible crash in edge temperature is visible following the ELM, nor is there a significant perturbation to the density.}\label{fig:trace_elmy_imode}}
\end{figure}

In light of the observed stability of I-mode to peeling-ballooning MHD -- even in cases where the perturbation of the putative sawtooth trigger is accounted for -- it is worthwhile to examine the behavior of the ELMs in I-mode compared to those found in more conventional H-modes.  Traces from a type-I ELMy H-mode and an I-mode are shown in \cref{fig:trace_elmy_imode}.  The ELMy case (left) exhibits behavior typical of a type-I ELM cycle: discrete, regular ELMs (visible on the $H_\alpha$ trace), with crashes in edge temperature as the ELM expels energy and particles into the SOL.  The effects of the sawteeth are distinct from the ELM, with a spike and subsequent relaxation in edge temperature from the heat pulse visible on the edge ECE $T_e$ separate from the sharp temperature-pedestal crash due to the ELM.  The sporadic sawtooth-triggered events in I-mode (right), despite a similar trace in $H_\alpha$, do not exhibit the characteristic crash in edge temperature associated with an ELM -- rather, only the spike in $T_e$ from the sawtooth heat pulse is visible, followed by a relaxation to the steady pedestal temperature.

The distinction between the two edge perturbations is visible in a single case, shown in \cref{fig:trace_imode_welms}.  The sawtooth heat pulse at $\SI{0.87}{\second}$ triggers an I-H transition, indicated by the reduction in $H_\alpha$ light following the pulse from the sawtooth, and the sudden reduction in turbulence visible in the $\tilde{n}_e$ spectrogram (both destroying the WCM fluctuation at $\sim \SI{300}{\kilo\hertz}$, and further reducing the mid-frequency broadband turbulence).  Such a transition is not unheard-of -- recall that the L-I transition is tied to sawtooth heat pulses as well.  This H-mode terminates with a non-sawtooth-triggered ELM at $\SI{0.885}{\second}$, with the customary crash in edge temperature and $H_\alpha$ spike.  After the H-mode terminates, the plasma reverts to I-mode, with a further sawtooth-triggered event at $\SI{0.91}{\second}$.  Although there does appear to be some $T_e$ reduction due to the ELM, it is insufficient to outweigh the $T_e$ spike from the sawtooth heat pulse.

This H-mode terminates with a non-sawtooth-triggered ELM with visible edge temperature crash and density perturbation, dropping back into I-mode.  The I-mode phase also exhibits sawtooth-triggered ELM-like events with minimal density perturbation or temperature crash.}\label{fig:trace_imode_welms}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/IModeModeling/trace_imode_welms_2.pdf}}
\end{figure}

Given that these majority cases (shown in \cref{fig:trace_elmy_imode} at right) do not exhibit the expected temperature pedestal crash and are MHD-stable, it is apparent that these cases are not instability-triggered ELMs at all, but rather are a distinct, and far more benign, phenomenon.  For clarity, we will call these ``sawtooth $H_\alpha$ spikes'' (indeed, this seems to be the only distinguishing factor for these edge events!).  A plausible explanation is that the sawtooth does not trigger an instability in the edge, but instead propagates into the scrape-off layer.  The heat pulse then creates a propagating ionization front as it encounters the cold plasma and neutral gas in the SOL.  The burst of $H_\alpha$ light and subsequent exponential decay is due to this sudden pulse energizing neutrals in the edge.  Fundamentally, the $H_\alpha$ spike from a conventional ELM is driven by the same cause -- a sudden influx of particles and energy into the SOL, as well as a similar ionization front in the neutrals in the far SOL.  However, the underlying phenomenon of these events is not entirely clear -- even under comparable conditions, the spikes are not consistently triggered by similarly-sized sawtooth heat pulses.  The edge behavior of these cases is therefore a subject of continuing investigation.

In addition to the sawtooth-triggered $H_\alpha$ spike events described above, a minority of edge $H_\alpha$ events do exhibit the characteristic temperature crash of an ELM, and are not in all cases triggered by a sawtooth (although some of these cases may be compound ELMs following a sawtooth-triggered event).  Peeling-ballooning and KBM stability analysis of such a case is presented in \cref{fig:imode_elite_nonstelms}.  In this case, a single ELM is visible at $\SI{1.1}{\second}$, independent of the sawtooth cycle -- rather, the characteristic crash is visible in the edge temperature after relaxation of the temperature from the sawtooth heat pulse (note, however, that the ELM does not significantly perturb the stored energy/global-averaged pressure).  When modeled in ELITE and BALOO, however, the steady I-mode phase around the ELM is nevertheless found to be well into the stable region both for infinite-$n$ ballooning modes and finite-$n$ coupled peeling-ballooning modes.  While it is possible that a transient effect not captured by the profiles used for the stability calculation drove the pedestal near the classical ELM stability boundary in this case, the stationary state for the plasma is evidently stable to the expected ELM triggers.\nicesectionending

\section{Summary \& Discussion}\label{sec:imode_mod_conclusions}

Models for the trigger of large, deleterious ELMs based on coupled peeling-ballooning MHD instabilities \cite{Wilson2002,Snyder2003,Snyder2004,Wilson2006} and kinetic-ballooning turbulence \cite{Snyder1999,Candy2005,Snyder2001} have been particularly successful in capturing the physics underlying the ELMy H-mode pedestal.  This approach is applied to the I-mode pedestal.  The majority of I-mode cases are naturally free of ELMs, and are modeled to be strongly stable both to coupled peeling-ballooning MHD modes and to KBM turbulence (calculated by way of the infinite-$n$ ideal-ballooning MHD surrogate).  Under certain conditions, particularly reduced plasma current and magnetic field, the I-mode exhibits small, intermittent ELM-like events.  The majority of these cases are evidently tied to the sawtooth heat pulse reaching the plasma edge, and lack the characteristic edge temperature crash expected due to the expulsion of energy and particles by the ELM.  This, coupled with the computed stability of these pedestals (even when the data are treated to account for the transient modification of the temperature pedestal by the sawtooth), suggests that the phenomenon is distinct from a traditional type-I ELM, with the measured spike in $H_\alpha$ light (customarily indicative of an ELM) possibly driven by an ionization front in the SOL from the sawtooth heat pulse propagation, rather than an explosive edge instability.  A minority of ELM events in I-mode exhibit the characteristic $T_e$ crash, including some events that are not evidently triggered by the sawtooth heat pulse.  The steady I-mode phases around these events, however, are also modeled to be stable, indicating a transient event not captured by these models driving the ELM instability.

This assay into the computed stability of I-mode is consistent with the observed absence of large, deleterious type-I ELMs in I-mode.  This stability is self-enforcing, from the fundamental nature of the I-mode pedestal -- the pressure pedestal is set largely by the strong temperature pedestal, with the flat density profile suppressing both the pressure gradient and the bootstrap current drive.  For minority of I-mode cases exhibiting apparent ELMs, most cases are evidently not ``true'' instability-driven ELMs, but are rather a benign sawtooth-triggered $H_\alpha$ spike.  In the minority of edge events, an edge temperature crash is present, indicating an ELM; however, these crashes are small ($<1\%$ perturbation to stored energy), with the temperature crash in sawtooth-triggered cases insufficient to overcome the positive effect of the heat pulse on the edge temperature.  Moreover, these I-mode cases exhibiting ELMs are typically the \emph{lower} performance cases, with less agressive fueling and heating power, reaching lower pedestal beta.

It is worth noting that more conventional ``ELM-suppressed'' regimes (\eg RMP-suppressed H-modes, QH-mode) also can still present ELMs, with the suppression resulting in smaller, less dangerous ELMs rather than completely removing them.  While some ELM behavior is evidently endemic to high-performance pedestals, this behavior is limited in I-mode to small, intermittent events -- the existing I-mode parameter space is naturally stable against large (type-I) ELMs, as desired for a putative reactor regime.\nicechapterending
