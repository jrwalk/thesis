 By default (``L-mode''), rapid transport of energy and particles from plasma driven by turbulence
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item and energy transport gets \emph{worse} with more heating power!

\begin{frame}{The solution?}
 \large
 Under right conditions, plasma forms ``transport barrier'' in edge, with steep gradients in density and temperature -- the \emph{pedestal}
 
 $\rightarrow$ plasma transitions to ``high-confinement'' or H-mode
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item immediate factor of $\sim 2$ increase in energy confinement
  \item pedestal supports higher core pressures $=$ fusion power density

 \large
 ELMs denoted by:
 \begin{itemize}
  \large
  \item burst of ionization in edge $\rightarrow$ spike in $H_\alpha$ light
  \item ``explosive'' crash in pedestal, both temperature and pressure
  \item unstable fluctuation leading up to ELM (P-B MHD instability, magnetic precursors, turbulent fluctuations...)
 \end{itemize}
 
 \vspace{1em}
 observations of ELMs in I-mode based on $H_\alpha$ spikes, in most cases ($\sim$ 70\%) tied to the sawtooth heat pulse reaching the edge -- good place to begin!

 Given the lack of a temperature pedestal crash and the computed stability against known ELM triggers, these events appear to not be instability-driven ELMs at all -- best described simply as ``sawtooth-driven $H_\alpha$ bursts.''
 
 \vspace{0.5em}
 possible explanations:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item ionization front impacting neutrals in SOL?
  \item density transport effect from sawtooth interaction with WCM?
 \end{itemize}
 
 which raise questions:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item why are these sometimes triggered -- field, shaping, density effects?
  \item under comparable conditions, why are $H_\alpha$ spikes inconsistently triggered by similarly-sized sawteeth?
