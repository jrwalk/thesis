 By default (``L-mode''), rapid transport of energy and particles from plasma driven by turbulence

 Under right conditions, plasma forms ``transport barrier'' in edge, with steep gradients in density and temperature -- the \emph{pedestal}
 
 $\rightarrow$ plasma transitions to \textcolor{red}{``high-confinement'' or H-mode}
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item immediate factor of $\sim 2$ increase in energy confinement
  \item pedestal supports higher core pressures $=$ fusion power density

 ELITE solves this for given $n$ by encoding the poloidal angle $\chi$ in a straight-line coordinate via the ``ballooning transform,''
 
 \begin{equation*}
  \omega = \frac{1}{q} \int^\chi \nu \;d\chi
 \end{equation*}
 
 (note $2\pi q = \oint \nu \;d\chi$) and decomposing the displacement $X$ into poloidal harmonics
 
 \begin{equation*}
  X = \sum_m u_m(\psi) e^{-im\omega}
 \end{equation*}
 
 centered on the $(m,n)$ rational surface.  Define a ``fast'' radial variable
 
 \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
   x &= m_0 - nq\\
   m_0 &= \mbox{Int}(nq_a) + 1
  \end{aligned}
 \end{equation*}
 
 readily convertible between $x$ and $\psi$.

 Euler-Lagrange equation minimizing the energy may be expressed in this harmonic expansion by a set of coupled equations\footnote[7]{HR Wilson \emph{et al.}, \emph{Physics of Plasmas} \textbf{9} (2002)}
 
 \begin{equation*}
  A^{(2)}_{m,m'} \frac{d^2 u_m}{d\psi^2} + A^{(1)}_{m,m'} \frac{du_m}{d\psi} + A^{(0)}_{m,m'} u_m = 0
 \end{equation*}
 
 describing coupling between harmonics $m,m'$, with matrix elements $A$ calculated from the equilibrium describing the mode amplitudes.  Features:
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $u_m$ varies rapidly ($\sim x$, comparable to spacing between rational surfaces), needs fine mesh; $A$ set by equilibrium parameters, varies more slowly, can be calculated on coarse mesh for numerical efficiency
  \item modes only couple to few nearest neighbors, so most $A_{m,m'}$ may be ignored
  \item can quickly calculate ``fictitious eigenvalue'' for stable/unstable determination, or true eigenvalue $\gamma^2$ for mode growth rate when inertial terms included (modifications to matrix elements $A$)
 \end{itemize}

 BALOO solves simplified version of ballooning energy formulation, in the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit: reduces to 1-D eigenvalue equation,
 
 \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
   &(L_0 + \omega^2 M_0) f = 0\\
   &X = f(\psi,y) e^{-in\int \nu \;dy}
  \end{aligned}
 \end{equation*}
 
 for displacement $X$ and ballooning-transformed angle $y$, given by
 
 \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
  L_0 f &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left\{ \frac{1}{JR^2 B_p^2} \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{R^2 B_p^2}{B} \int^y \frac{d\nu}{d\psi} dy \right)^2 \right] \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right\}\\
  &\qquad + f \left\{ \frac{2J}{B^2} \frac{dp}{d\psi} \frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left( p + \frac{B^2}{2} \right) - \frac{F}{B^4} \frac{dp}{d\psi} \left( \int^y \frac{d\nu}{d\psi} dy \right) \frac{\partial B^2}{\partial y} \right\}\\
  M_0 f &= \frac{J}{R^2 B_p^2} \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{R^2 B_p^2}{B} \int^y \frac{d\nu}{d\psi} dy \right)^2 \right] f
