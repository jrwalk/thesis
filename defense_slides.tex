\begin{frame}{The problem...}

 \large
 By default (``L-mode''), rapid transport of energy and particles from plasma driven by turbulence
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item and energy transport gets \emph{worse} with more heating power!
  \item need very strong magnetic field and/or large machine size to overcome poor plasma performance
 \end{itemize}
 
\begin{emphblock}{}
  \centering
  L-mode likely not suitable for (economical) power plant development.
 \end{emphblock}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The solution?}
 \large
 Under right conditions, plasma forms ``transport barrier'' in edge, with steep gradients in density and temperature -- the \emph{pedestal}
 
 $\rightarrow$ plasma transitions to ``high-confinement'' or H-mode
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item immediate factor of $\sim 2$ increase in energy confinement
  \item pedestal supports higher core pressures $=$ fusion power density
  \item \textcolor{red}{pedestal height sets strong constraint on global performance}
 \end{itemize}

 \begin{columns}[c]
  \column{0.5\textwidth}
  \vspace{-2em}
  \begin{itemize}
   \large
   \item increased particle confinement $=$ plasma retains impurities as well as fuel ions
   \vspace{0.5em}
   \item radiated power ($\sim Z^2$ for a given impurity species) increases, overcomes heating power $\rightarrow$ plasma drops back into L-mode
   \vspace{0.5em}
   \item \textcolor{red}{inherently transient state}
  \end{itemize}

so, we need:
\begin{itemize}
 \item high energy confinement
 \item low particle confinement (low enough, at least)
 \item ... and that's it, right?

\begin{frame}{The solution? (part II)}

 \begin{columns}[c]
  \column{0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
   \large
   \item Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs) -- instabilities that relax the pedestal, drive bursts of energy, particle transport, enough to prevent impurity accumulation
   \vspace{0.5em}
   \onslide<2>{\item \textcolor{red}{large ELMs drive pulsed heat loads in excess of plasma-facing material tolerances}}
