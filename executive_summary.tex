\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The development\gnote{not sure how specific to be with cites} of magnetic-confinement fusion into an economical form of power generation is characterized by two overarching and seemingly-contradictory requirements: first, a high level of energy confinement is necessary to reach the desired level of self-heating of the plasma by fusion products, and second, a low level of particle confinement to avoid the deleterious effects of accumulated impurities (both the helium ``fusion ash'' and eroded plasma-facing wall materials).  The latter is particularly important for the high-$Z$ impurities expected from the metal wall materials necessary for reactor-scale devices \cite{Loarte2007,Joffrin2014}.  A number of operating regimes, collectively termed \emph{H-modes} \cite{Wagner1982}, have been developed satisfying these requirements in varying degrees.  These regimes are characterized by the formation of a \emph{pedestal}, a region of steep gradient in density, temperature, and pressure at the plasma edge that acts as a transport barrier in the plasma.  The structure introduces an additional constraint, however -- the steep gradients act as a source of free energy for explosive Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs), which on reactor-scale devices drive transient heat loading and erosion damage in excess of material tolerances for plasma-facing surfaces \cite{Federici2003}.

As the width and height of the pedestal set a strong constraint on both global performance \cite{Kinsey2011} and stability against ELMs \cite{Snyder2003}, a firm understanding of the physics governing the pedestal structure is essential for the extrapolation of high-performance regimes to ITER- and reactor-scale operation.  This thesis contributes to the understanding of pedestal physics and high-performance operation in several key areas:
