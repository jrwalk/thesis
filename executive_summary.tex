\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The development of magnetic-confinement fusion into an economical form of power generation is characterized by two overarching and seemingly-contradictory requirements: first, a high level of energy confinement is necessary to reach the desired level of self-heating of the plasma by fusion products, and second, a low level of particle confinement to avoid the deleterious effects of accumulated impurities (both the helium ``fusion ash'' and eroded plasma-facing wall materials).  The latter is particularly important for the high-$Z$ impurities expected from the metal wall materials necessary for reactor-scale devices.  A number of operating regimes, collectively termed \emph{H-modes}, have been developed satisfying these requirements in varying degrees.  These regimes are characterized by the formation of a \emph{pedestal}, a region of steep gradient in density, temperature, and pressure at the plasma edge that acts as a transport barrier in the plasma.  The structure introduces an additional constraint, however -- the steep gradients act as a source of free energy for explosive Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs), which on reactor-scale devices drive transient heat loading and erosion damage in excess of material tolerances for plasma-facing surfaces.

As the width and height of the pedestal set a strong constraint on both global performance and stability against ELMs, a firm understanding of the physics governing the pedestal structure is essential for the extrapolation of high-performance regimes to ITER- and reactor-scale operation.  This thesis contributes to the understanding of pedestal physics and high-performance operation in two key areas:

\begin{description}
 \item[Predictive ELMy H-mode physics] \hfill \\
 ELMy H-mode is commonly accessible on major tokamak experiments, and is considered the baseline for operation on ITER \cite{Shimada2007}.  However, as large, uncontrolled ELMs are incompatible with ITER or reactor operation, an understanding of the stability space for ELM suppression, mitigation, or avoidance is necessary.  This thesis details the testing of the predictive EPED model to operation on Alcator C-Mod.  These experiments significantly expanded the parameter range on which EPED has been tested, particularly across a broad range in magnetic fields on C-Mod, and at the highest thermal pressures of any existing tokamak, within a factor of $\sim 2$ of the target pedestal pressure for ITER.  The methods developed in this analysis are subsequently applied to the examination of I-mode pedestals.
 \item[I-Mode Pedestal Structure, Performance, \& Stability] \hfill \\
 I-mode \cite{Whyte2010} is a novel high-performance regime pioneered on Alcator C-Mod, unique in that it develops an H-mode-like temperature pedestal and good energy confinement, without the accompanying density pedestal or suppression of particle transport.  I-mode exhibits three highly attractive properties for a reactor regime:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item the lack of a particle transport barrier maintains the desired level of impurity flushing from the plasma, naturally allowing stationary operation with low radiative losses
  \item Energy confinement in I-mode degrades significantly more weakly with increased heating power compared to H-mode, a highly desirable result for fusion self-heated plasmas
  \item I-mode appears to be inherently stable against large, deleterious ELMs, avoiding the need for externally-applied mitigation/suppression techniques
 \end{enumerate}
 
This thesis first details an empirical study of the pedestal structure in I-mode, particularly its response to fueling and heating power, and its impact on global confinement and performance.  It then details a computational study of the I-mode pedestal with regards to ELM stability, using the physics techniques developed for ELMy H-modes.
\end{description}

\noindent The results in this thesis have been published in a number of peer-reviewed papers, both for the ELMy H-mode results \cite{Walk2012} (also featuring in a multi-machine Joint Research Target \cite{Groebner2013}) and for I-mode \cite{Walk2014}.

\section*{ELMy H-modes}

The pedestal in ELMy H-mode is thought to be limited by two constraints: the onset of edge peeling-ballooning MHD instabilities, and transport driven by kinetic-ballooning mode (KBM) turbulence \cite{Snyder2011}.  Experimental observations on C-Mod are consistent with these constraints, particularly when the pedestal data is masked to time frames immediately preceding the ELM crashes -- a practice that, despite diagnostic difficulties on C-Mod, produces data most closely corresponding to the pedestal structure at the point of ELM instability.

The pedestal width is well-described by the prediction based on KBM physics, which predicts for the width $\Delta_\psi$ (here defined as the average of the density and temperature pedestal widths in normalized poloidal flux space) the relation $\Delta_\psi = G(\nu^*,\varepsilon,...) \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$, where $G(\nu^*,\varepsilon,...)$ is a weakly-varying function of plasma shape, aspect ratio, collisionality, and other dimensionless parameters (\cref{fig:elmy_wid_betapol}).  This scale function is fitted to a value of $\langle G \rangle \approx 0.085$, consistent with observations on other devices.  Over the range in width and $\beta_{p,ped}$ seen on C-Mod, the secondary dependences of the width (encoded in $G$) are negligible -- the width is well-described by the simple $\Delta_\psi \sim \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$ scaling. Moreover, the width is not well-described by the predictions from neutral-penetration models (consistent with the highly opaque SOL on C-Mod) or models based on ion-orbit loss, predicting $\Delta \sim \rho_{i,pol}$, indicating that the KBM limit most accurately describes the pedestal width.

\end{figure}

\noindent The pressure profile is also consistent with the expected limit from peeling-ballooning MHD, particularly the $\nabla p \sim I_p^2$ expected from ideal ballooning modes.  Taking the pressure pedestal height to scale as $p_{ped} \sim \nabla p \times \Delta_{p}$, the measured height trends as $I_p^2 \sqrt{\beta_{p,ped}} \sim I_p \sqrt{n_{e,ped} T_{e,ped}}$ (\cref{fig:elmy_IprootneTe_p95}).  With the fairly restricted range in both width and $\beta_{p,ped}$ typically seen on C-Mod due to the restricted, weak shaping needed for ELMy H-mode access, this reduces in the lowest order to a robust pedestal width with $p_{ped} \sim \nabla p \sim I_p^2$.

The red-blue contours show the peeling-ballooning growth rate with diamagnetic stabilization, $\gamma/(\omega_{*eff}/2)$, while white contours show the width in flux space that is unstable to the KBM.  To within error bars, the pedestal lies on the peeling-ballooning boundary.  The comparatively higher collisionality typical of C-Mod H-mode pedestals pushes the MHD behavior of the pedestal towards higher-$n$, pure-ballooning modes, although moderate-$n$ coupled modes in the ``nose'' of the stability contour are also common.}\label{fig:elmy_elite}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/ELMy/elmy_elite.pdf}}
\end{figure}

The peeling-ballooning MHD and KBM limits are examined in more detail using the ELITE and BALOO numerical codes (with the latter calculating the KBM threshold via an infinite-$n$ ideal MHD surrogate), with results shown in \cref{fig:elmy_elite}.  These calculations are combined in the EPED model, particularly the most recent iteration, EPED1.63 (a minor modification to EPED1.6 to account for the strong diamagnetic stabilization effects expected for the pedestal on C-Mod).  The EPED predictions for the pedestal height match well to observed pressure pedestals (to within the systematic $\pm 20\%$ error in EPED predictions), particularly when compared to measured pedestals masked to the ELM cycle as described above (see \cref{fig:elmy_pped_EPED}), with an average ratio of measured to predicted pedestal pressure of $0.94 \pm 0.066$.  While systematic tests of the predicted pedestal width against EPED predictions are difficult due to the narrow range over which the experimental $\Delta_\psi$ varies, EPED does reproduce the pedestal width to within $\pm 20\%$ while capturing the robustness of the pedestal width.

\end{figure}

The experiments presented in this thesis greatly expanded the parameter range over which EPED has been tested, with magnetic field ranging over $3.5-\SI{8}{\tesla}$ (reaching the highest field of any tokamak experiment), as well as reaching to within a factor of $\sim 2$ of the target pedestal thermal pressure for ITER (\cref{fig:elmy_epedpredictions_cmod}).  The ELMy H-mode is assumed to be the baseline high-performance scenario for ITER; moreover, the stability boundaries associated with the ELM trigger set upper bounds on the pedestal structure in other H-mode regimes.  As such, a first-principles physics understanding of the ELM limit, as provided by EPED and thoroughly tested experimentally (including the work in this thesis), is essential for extrapolation of high-confinement regimes to ITER.  The analyses developed here for ELMy H-mode are subsequently applied to the understanding of I-mode pedestals.

\section*{I-Mode Pedestals \& Performance}

Empirical observations of the I-mode pedestal structure are illuminating in terms of the observed global behavior in I-mode.  The formation of a hot, H-mode-like temperature pedestal provides good energy confinement while naturally operating at ITER-relevant collisionality, while the absence of a density pedestal prevents the accumulation of impurities -- particularly important for machines operating with high heat fluxes onto high-$Z$ metal plasma-facing components, as is the case for C-Mod, and as expected for ITER.

\begin{figure}[h]

At the L-I transition, the core and edge temperature rise over several sawtooth cycles before reaching a steady level; global confinement and pressure rise accordingly.  However, the density remains at L-mode levels, and no ELMs are exhibited.  (right) Edge profiles for density, temperature, and pressure in L-, I-, and H-mode.  The I-mode (green) retains an density profile comparable to the L-mode (black), unlike the ELMy (red) and EDA (blue) H-modes which form a strong density pedestal.  However, the I-mode forms a higher temperature pedestal than either H-mode.  As a result, the I-mode reaches comparable pedestal pressures to the H-modes while retaining L-mode particle transport.}\label{fig:imode_trace_ped}}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Pedestal Responses to Engineering Controls}

The temperature pedestal in I-mode exhibits some H-mode-like behavior, particularly in its response to plasma current $T_{e,ped} \sim I_p$.  Notably, I-mode temperature pedestals typically exceed that in a comparable H-mode (albeit at lower density).  This is highly beneficial for global performance, as high temperature pedestals support steep core temperature gradients via marginally-stable stiff temperature profiles, sustaining high core temperatures.  Provided a moderate degree of density peaking (typically in the range of $n_{e0}/\langle n_e \rangle \sim 1.2$ in I-mode), this leads to comparable core and volume-averaged pressure to H-mode despite the comparatively reduced pedestal pressure in I-mode.  The temperature pedestal responds strongly to heating power, $T_{e,ped} \sim P_{net}/\overline{n}_e$ (effectively, heating power per particle) at fixed current.  This is distinct from the behavior in ELMy H-mode, for which the temperature responds only weakly to heating power (rather, elevated power tends to increase ELM-driven heat transport to maintain the limited $\beta_{p,ped}$ in the pedestal).  Transport-limited EDA H-modes also exhibit a response in the pedestal temperature with power-per-particle, suggesting that I-mode pedestals are similarly not stability-limited.

\begin{figure}[ht]

The three discharges are fueled to $\overline{n}_e$ of $\num{1.0}$ (black), $\num{1.3}$ (blue), and $\SI{1.7e20}{\per\meter\cubed}$ (red) respectively, with heating powers of $\num{2.75}$, $\num{3.65}$, and $\SI{4.10}{\mega\watt}$ to maintain matched $P_{net}/\overline{n}_e \sim 2.4-2.7$.  The constant power-per-particle maintains matched temperature pedestals across the fueling range, indicative of the independent control of pedestal $n_e$ and $T_e$ available in I-mode.}\label{fig:imode_fuelingprofiles}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/IModePedestal/fuelingprofiles.pdf}}
\end{figure}

In contrast, the density profile is set by operator-controlled fueling, independent of the stability or transport-driven limits found in H-mode, due to the L-mode-like density profile.  Given sufficient heating power to maintain $P_{net}/\overline{n}_e$, temperature pedestals are matched across a broad range of fueling (\cref{fig:imode_fuelingprofiles}).  Fueling and heating power are thus largely-independent ``knobs'' for operator control of pedestal profiles, in contrast to both stability-limited ELMy H-mode pedestals (where the density and temperature are inversely proportional to maintain the fixed $\beta_{p,ped}$ limit) and EDA H-modes, where the density is locked to a transport-limited value set by the plasma current, insensitive to operator fueling.

The pressure pedestal reflects this beneficial behavior, scaling as $p_{ped} \sim I_p$ and $p_{ped} \sim P_{net}$ (consistent with the temperature scaling as $P_{net}/\overline{n}_e$ and $p_{ped} \sim n_{e,ped} T_{e,ped}$).  The pedestal pressure is typically reduced compared to comparable H-modes due to the lower density, and exhibits a pressure gradient that is relaxed compared to H-mode, and trends more weakly than $I_p^2$, consistent with MHD stability in the pedestal and with the lack of large ELMs.  The strong scaling with heating power is consistent with a lack of degradation of $\tau_E$ with heating power, distinct from the $\tau_E \sim P^{-0.7}$ expected for H-mode.  This behavior is quite favorable when scaled to large, high-power machines, particularly in high-$Q$ scenarios with significant fusion self-heating where the plasma pressure directly determines the heating power via the fusion reaction rate (proportional to $p^2$).

\subsection*{Pedestal Width}

The pedestal width in I-mode appears to be quite robust, with no systematic trend with any of the examined physics parameters.  In particular, no dependence on $\beta_{p,ped}$ is seen, in contrast to the expectation for pedestals limited by KBM turbulence, with I-mode pedestals consistently broader than predicted by an EPED-like relation (\cref{fig:imode_wid_betapol}).  Similarly, no width dependence in the temperature or pressure pedestal is seen with gyroradius (thus ion-orbit-loss models), collisionality or safety factor (thus edge current and magnetic shear impact on MHD stability), or heat flux through the pedestal.  The linear relationship between $p_{ped}$ and $\nabla p$ across the I-mode dataset (\cref{fig:imode_p_gradp}) suggests that MHD instability driven by the pressure gradient may still present an ultimate limit on the I-mode pedestal; however, the degree of operator control over pedestal profiles in I-mode will allow the operator to approach, but not exceed, the stability limit  in the pedestal.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Global Confinement \& Performance}

Although the I-mode exhibits a more relaxed pressure pedestal (\ie lower $\beta_{p,ped}$) compared to typical H-modes, the comparatively higher pedestal temperature supports steep core temperature profiles, reaching significant core and average pressure provided moderate density peaking.  I-mode reaches comparable levels of global (normalized) pressure, $\langle \beta_N \rangle$, maintaining good energy confinement (see \cref{fig:imode_betan_H}), while the relaxed pressure pedestal provides beneficial stability and impurity-confinement properties.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
 \pushtooutside
 \fcapside[60mm]{\caption[I-mode stored energy vs. heating power times plasma current.]{I-mode stored energy versus the product of net heating power $P_{net}$ and plasma current $I_p$.  Based on the H-mode confinement scaling, $\tau_E$ is expected to scale linearly with $I_p$, and to show a strong degradation with heating power: $\tau_E \sim I_p \times P_{net}^{-0.7}$.  As the stored energy is given by $W \sim P_{net} \tau_E$, $W \sim I_p P_{net}^{0.3}$ is expected.  The observed linear trend indicates little-to-no degradation of $\tau_E$ in I-mode with heating power.}\label{fig:imode_PIp_W}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/IModePedestal/PIp_W_scale.pdf}}
\end{figure}

The weak degradation of energy confinement with heating power is reflected in the stored energy, which scales as $W \sim P_{net} I_p$ -- by definition $W \sim P \tau_E$, and from the H-mode confinement scaling one expects $\tau_E \sim I_p$.  The $W \sim P_{net} I_p$ trend therefore indicates minimal dependence of $\tau_E$ on power, in contrast to the expected $W \sim P_{net}^{0.3} I_p$ for H-mode confinement.  This is consistent with the pedestal response, $p_{ped} \sim P_{net}$ at fixed current (as the pedestal pressure strongly constrains the core, $W \sim p_{ped}$).  The degradation of $\tau_E$ with heating power in H-mode reflects the MHD limits on the pedestal, for which increased heating power drives increased ELM heat transport to maintain the limited pedestal, in turn driving a weak increase in stored energy with heating power.  Thus, the lack of degradation in I-mode is indicative of the inherent MHD stability of the pedestal.  Similarly, the stored energy responds strongly to fueling, consistent with the strong pedestal response (provided sufficient heating power), in contrast to $\beta_p$-limited ELMy H-mode pedestals.  Like the strong response to heating power, this is desirable for a burning-plasma scenario, in which heating power $\sim P_{\alpha}$ is proportional to the square of the plasma density.

An examination of the I-mode energy confinement time under a power-law fit of the form used for the ITER89 and ITER98 scalings for L- and H-mode is consistent with the observed behavior in I-mode, particularly capturing the weak degradation with heating power ($\tau_E \sim P^{-0.28}$), as shown in \cref{fig:imode_tauE_6} (note that this includes a fixed $R^2 \sqrt{\varepsilon}$ size scaling assumed based on H-mode confinement -- size-independent single-machine scalings for C-Mod data capture the same behavior, however).  While this scaling is purely illustrative, as the examined parameter range is too restricted to confidently apply to other devices, such behavior would extrapolate to an energy confinement time of $\tau_E \sim \SI{8}{\second}$, well in excess of the $\tau_E \sim \SI{2.5}{\second}$ expected for ITER in H-mode (\cref{fig:imode_tauE_extrap}).

\end{figure}

Models for the trigger of large (type-I) ELMs based on coupled peeling-ballooning MHD instabilities and kinetic ballooning turbulence have been particularly successful in capturing the physics underlying the ELMy H-mode pedestal.  This approach is applied to the I-mode pedestal, using the ELITE code to calculate the finite-$n$ peeling-ballooning stability, and infinite-$n$ ballooning MHD modes calculated by BALOO as a surrogate for the KBM threshold.  The majority of I-mode cases are naturally free of large ELMs, and are modeled to be peeling-ballooning stable and below the KBM threshold, as shown in \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm} -- the ELITE calculations are shown in the red-blue contour, with the stability boundary of $\gamma/(\omega_{*pi}/2) = 1$ shown by the yellow dash, while the white BALOO contours indicate widths in poloidal flux space that are infinite-$n$ unstable, with the KBM threshold assumed to be when half of the pedestal width (indicated by $\Delta_\psi$) is locally unstable.  Notably, in the minority of I-mode cases exhibiting ELMs (or ELM-like events), the stationary pedestal structure is also modeled to be P-B and KBM stable, as shown in \cref{fig:imode_elite_stelm}.  The cases in \cref{fig:imode_elite_noelm,fig:imode_elite_stelm} also demonstrate the lack of dependence of the pedestal width on $\beta_{p,ped}$, as examples of pedestals near and far from the EPED-like KBM prediction (compare $\Delta_\psi$ to $\Delta_{EPED} = 0.076 \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$ for each).

The small, intermittent ELM-like pulses visible in the minority of I-mode cases (typically found at reduced current and toroidal field) exhibit distinct classes of phenomena: the majority of cases are seen to be synchronized with the sawtooth heat pulse reaching the pedestal, and do not appear to significantly perturb the edge temperature (see \cref{fig:trace_elmy_imode} for a comparison to the edge behavior in ELMy H-mode).

ELMs in H-mode (visible on the $H_\alpha$ trace) are independent of the sawtooth cycle, and drive perturbations to the edge temperature and line-integrated density, as both energy and particles are expelled form the plasma by the ELM crash.  This is particularly clear on the edge temperature, which exhibits a clear increase with the sawtooth heat pulse and a separate crash with the ELM.  I-mode, in contrast, exhibits ELMs (or ELM-like events) that are tied to sawtooth heat pulses reaching the edge, as visible on the ECE $T_e$ signal.

\noindent The lack of significant temperature perturbation, coupled with the fact that these pedestals are calculated to be peeling-ballooning and KBM stable even when the pedestal data is treated to account for the perturbation of the temperature pedestal by the sawtooth heat pulse, indicates that these events are not instability driven ELMs, but rather a more benign perturbation driving an ionization burst in the SOL without the pedestal crash associated with the ELM.  A minority of the ELM events in  I-mode do exhibit a negative perturbation to the temperature, and are not in all cases triggered by the sawtooth -- as the stationary pedestal structure in time windows containing these events are also stable as calculated by ELITE, it is evident that systemic pedestal instability is not the cause of these events, even in cases that may be ``true'' ELMs (that is, an explosive perturbation to the pedestal).  The cause of these intermittent events is unknown at this time, and the subject of future study -- however, it is clear that I-mode is robustly stable against the large, deleterious ELMs that must be avoided for ITER operation.

\section*{Impact \& Future Work}

The development and understanding of high-performance regimes which avoid large type-I ELMs -- either via physics solutions, in which the pedestal self-regulates such that the ELM boundary is not reached, or via engineering solutions to suppress or mitigate ELMs -- is of essential importance to the planning and development of operations on ITER and beyond.  This thesis has contributed both to the understanding of the physics limiting the ELMing pedestal, and to a novel means for high-performance operation in I-mode.  The benefits of I-mode have attracted significant interest in the fusion research community, although there is considerable research still necessary to develop I-mode into a readily-accessible regime in the high-performance ``toolkit'' for tokamaks.

While the work presented here forms a reasonable basis for the understanding of the stationary pedestal structure in I-mode, transient events and fluctuations -- ELMs and the weakly-coherent mode (WCM) fluctuation -- are not well-understood in I-mode.  Given its apparent role in regulating the density transport in I-mode, the WCM is of high importance for understanding the density profile, and is the subject of upcoming experiments studying its amplitude, radial extent, and localization in the pedestal to better characterize the fluctuation.  Similarly, further experimental and modeling efforts to capture the physics of the small, transient ELMs in I-mode are planned, with a focus on the perturbations (or lack thereof) to the pedestal, and nature of the interaction of the burst with SOL plasma and neutrals.

I-mode operation over an increased window in Greenwald fraction is also actively investigated -- higher density while maintaining the beneficial properties of I-mode is desirable for a burning plasma, for which the alpha heating power is proportional to $n_e^2$.  The strong response of the I-mode pedestal to fueling and heating power sets a clear path forward in this regard, with matched increases to maintain the target $OP_{net}/\overline{n}_e$ strongly increasing the pedestal poloidal beta and global performance.  Recent experiments have demonstrated this by fueling into established I-modes, ultimately reaching heating power levels that would trigger a transition to H-mode from an L-mode at comparable density, opening the upper bound for I-mode access.  Again, this path is desirable for a burning plasma, as the increased density itself raises the heating power to maintain the target, and is consistent with ITER simulations \cite{Whyte2011} suggesting possible I-mode access at reduced density on ITER, after which the increased fueling and heating power are sufficient to reach a $Q=10$ scenario.

Finally, research into I-mode access on existing larger devices -- while I-mode experiments have been carried out on ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D (with some I-mode-like features seen on JET as well), the regime has not been firmly established outside of C-Mod.  Due to the significant differences in parameter space (magnetic field, machine size, density, wall material, neutral-beam vs. RF heating power) between C-Mod and other major tokamaks, the window for I-mode access on other devices is not well-understood despite the relative ease of operation on C-Mod.  Further study both on C-Mod and at other experiments will be illuminating in this regard.
