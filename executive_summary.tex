\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The development\gnote{not sure how specific to be with cites} of magnetic-confinement fusion into an economical form of power generation is characterized by two overarching and seemingly-contradictory requirements: first, a high level of energy confinement is necessary to reach the desired level of self-heating of the plasma by fusion products, and second, a low level of particle confinement to avoid the deleterious effects of accumulated impurities (both the helium ``fusion ash'' and eroded plasma-facing wall materials).  The latter is particularly important for the high-$Z$ impurities expected from the metal wall materials necessary for reactor-scale devices.  A number of operating regimes, collectively termed \emph{H-modes}, have been developed satisfying these requirements in varying degrees.  These regimes are characterized by the formation of a \emph{pedestal}, a region of steep gradient in density, temperature, and pressure at the plasma edge that acts as a transport barrier in the plasma.  The structure introduces an additional constraint, however -- the steep gradients act as a source of free energy for explosive Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs), which on reactor-scale devices drive transient heat loading and erosion damage in excess of material tolerances for plasma-facing surfaces.

As the width and height of the pedestal set a strong constraint on both global performance and stability against ELMs, a firm understanding of the physics governing the pedestal structure is essential for the extrapolation of high-performance regimes to ITER- and reactor-scale operation.  This thesis contributes to the understanding of pedestal physics and high-performance operation in two key areas:\gnote{move these into sections, bullet results for each chapter?}

\begin{description}
 \item[Predictive ELMy H-mode physics] \hfill \\
 ELMy H-mode is commonly accessible on major tokamak experiments, and is considered the baseline for operation on ITER \cite{Shimada2007}.  However, as large, uncontrolled ELMs are incompatible with ITER or reactor operation, an understanding of the stability space for ELM suppression, mitigation, or avoidance is necessary.  This thesis details the testing of the predictive EPED model to operation on Alcator C-Mod.  These experiments significantly expanded the parameter range on which EPED has been tested, particularly across a broad range in magnetic fields on C-Mod, and at the highest thermal pressures of any existing tokamak, within a factor of $\sim 2$ of the target pedestal pressure for ITER.  The methods developed in this analysis are subsequently applied to the examination of I-mode pedestals.
 \item[I-Mode Pedestal Structure, Performance, \& Stability] \hfill \\
 I-mode \cite{Whyte2010} is a novel high-performance regime pioneered on Alcator C-Mod, unique in that it develops an H-mode-like temperature pedestal and good energy confinement, without the accompanying density pedestal or suppression of particle transport.  I-mode exhibits three highly attractive properties for a reactor regime:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item the lack of a particle transport barrier maintains the desired level of impurity flushing from the plasma, naturally allowing stationary operation with low radiative losses
  \item Energy confinement in I-mode degrades significantly more weakly with increased heating power compared to H-mode, a highly desirable result for fusion self-heated plasmas
  \item I-mode appears to be inherently stable against large, deleterious ELMs, avoiding the need for externally-applied mitigation/suppression techniques
 \end{enumerate}
 
This thesis first details an empirical study of the pedestal structure in I-mode, particularly its response to fueling and heating power, and its impact on global confinement and performance.  It then details a computational study of the I-mode pedestal with regards to ELM stability, using the physics techniques developed for ELMy H-modes.
\end{description}

\noindent The results in this thesis have been published in a number of peer-reviewed papers, both for the ELMy H-mode results \cite{Walk2012} (also featuring in a multi-machine Joint Research Target \cite{Groebner2013}) and for I-mode \cite{Walk2014}.

\section*{ELMy H-modes}

The pedestal in ELMy H-mode is thought to be limited by two constraints: the onset of edge peeling-ballooning MHD instabilities, and transport driven by kinetic-ballooning mode (KBM) turbulence \cite{Snyder2011}.  Experimental observations on C-Mod are consistent with these constraints, particularly when the pedestal data is masked to time frames immediately preceding the ELM crashes -- a practice that, despite diagnostic difficulties on C-Mod, produces data most closely corresponding to the pedestal structure at the point of ELM instability.

The pedestal width is well-described by the prediction based on KBM physics, which predicts for the width $\Delta_\psi$ (here defined as the average of the density and temperature pedestal widths in normalized poloidal flux space) the relation $\Delta_\psi = G(\nu^*,\varepsilon,...) \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$, where $G(\nu^*,\varepsilon,...)$ is a weakly-varying function of plasma shape, aspect ratio, collisionality, and other dimensionless parameters (\cref{fig:elmy_wid_betapol}).  This scale function is fitted to a value of $\langle G \rangle \approx 0.085$, consistent with observations on other devices.  Over the range in width and $\beta_{p,ped}$ seen on C-Mod, the secondary dependences of the width (encoded in $G$) are negligible -- the width is well-described by the simple $\Delta_\psi \sim \beta_{p,ped}^{1/2}$ scaling. Moreover, the width is not well-described by the predictions from neutral-penetration models (consistent with the highly opaque SOL on C-Mod) or models based on ion-orbit loss, predicting $\Delta \sim \rho_{i,pol}$, indicating that the KBM limit most accurately describes the pedestal width.

\end{figure}

\noindent The pressure profile is also consistent with the expected limit from peeling-ballooning MHD, particularly the $\nabla p \sim I_p^2$ expected from ideal ballooning modes.  Taking the pressure pedestal height to scale as $p_{ped} \sim \nabla p \times \Delta_{p}$, the measured height trends as $I_p^2 \sqrt{\beta_{p,ped}} \sim I_p \sqrt{n_{e,ped} T_{e,ped}}$ (\cref{fig:elmy_IprootneTe_p95}).  With the fairly restricted range in both width and $\beta_{p,ped}$ typically seen on C-Mod due to the restricted, weak shaping needed for ELMy H-mode access, this reduces in the lowest order to a robust pedestal width with $p_{ped} \sim \nabla p \sim I_p^2$.

The red-blue contours show the peeling-ballooning growth rate with diamagnetic stabilization, $\gamma/(\omega_{*eff}/2)$, while white contours show the width in flux space that is unstable to the KBM.  To within error bars, the pedestal lies on the peeling-ballooning boundary.  The comparatively higher collisionality typical of C-Mod H-mode pedestals pushes the MHD behavior of the pedestal towards higher-$n$, pure-ballooning modes, although moderate-$n$ coupled modes in the ``nose'' of the stability contour are also common.}\label{fig:elmy_elite}}{\includegraphics[width=100mm]{graphics/ELMy/elmy_elite.pdf}}
\end{figure}

The peeling-ballooning MHD and KBM limits are examined in more detail using the ELITE and BALOO numerical codes (with the latter calculating the KBM threshold via an infinite-$n$ ideal MHD surrogate), with results shown in \cref{fig:elmy_elite}.  These calculations are combined in the EPED model, particularly the most recent iteration, EPED1.63 (a minor modification to EPED1.6 to account for the strong diamagnetic stabilization effects expected for the pedestal on C-Mod).  The EPED predictions for the pedestal height match well to observed pressure pedestals (to within the systematic $\pm 20\%$ error in EPED predictions), particularly when compared to measured pedestals masked to the ELM cycle as described above (see \cref{fig:elmy_pped_EPED}), with an average ratio of measured to predicted pedestal pressure of $0.94 \pm 0.066$.  While systematic tests of the predicted pedestal width against EPED predictions are difficult due to the narrow range over which the experimental $\Delta_\psi$ varies, EPED does reproduce the pedestal width to within $\pm 20\%$ while capturing the robustness of the pedestal width.

\end{figure}

The experiments presented in this thesis greatly expanded the parameter range over which EPED has been tested, with magnetic field ranging over $3.5-\SI{8}{\tesla}$ (reaching the highest field of any tokamak experiment), as well as reaching to within a factor of $\sim 2$ of the target pedestal thermal pressure for ITER (\cref{fig:elmy_epedpredictions_cmod}).  The ELMy H-mode is assumed to be the baseline high-performance scenario for ITER; moreover, the stability boundaries associated with the ELM trigger set upper bounds on the pedestal structure in other H-mode regimes.  As such, a first-principles physics understanding of the ELM limit, as provided by EPED and thoroughly tested experimentally (including the work in this thesis), is essential for extrapolation of high-confinement regimes to ITER.  The analyses developed here for ELMy H-mode are subsequently applied to the understanding of I-mode pedestals.
